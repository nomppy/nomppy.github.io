### Me
Hello and welcome to the source code of my website ([link](https://kennethsun.net)).
I primarily study physics and math, though I am also very interested in psychology, philosophy, and history. 

I also like playing piano, coding, reading[^1], and writing (which [you can read](/posts) if you want to learn more).

### Contact
Feel free to get in touch through email: <a href="mailto:kennett.sun@gmail.com">kennett.sun@gmail.com</a>. 
I'm usually happy to talk about anything and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
