title: losses (i am lucky)

there are two high school in my math 493 class, and everyone else is either juniors or seniors in math. 
math 493, abstract algebra, is reputedly one of the most difficult class in the undergraduate curriculum, and usually taken in the last year of college studies, but here they were anyway.

at first i thought: "i could’ve been in a similar situation. in high school i could’ve taken calc bc my first year, and spent the next three years going through an undergrad math curriculum. i would be in 493 only a year earlier, but following the standard progression instead of jumping around out of necessity like i am doing now. after calc bc in hs, i in effect had no meaningful math for the rest of my years."

i lost so much time, and in some way i feel that my school system failed me by not telling me about opportunities to learn more advanced math. in my middle school they’d given me special attention and put in effort to make sure i learned math, but then i moved to a different high school where my counselor didnt care at all what i did.

if i’d stayed in the same system for hs, they’d probably have sent me to a university for real math.

on the other hand, my old middle school was in ohio, which is enough of a reason to leave by itself, though at the same time i probably could’ve had a better chance of going to places like MIT if i stayed in that track through highschool. 

i talk about my case in particular because i know it well, but it certainly isnt special in a broad sense. those two kids in 493 are lucky to be from ann arbor, and lucky to have supportive parents who probably tutored them as kids to advance them through the public school curriculum. 

most kid are not so lucky. 

when lamenting about a path one could’ve gone down, its easy to forget the positives on the current path. the racial oppression in an ohioan suburb might’ve made a good college essay, but all the torment and isolation might just as well made me unrecoverably deranged and mentally ill, which is certainly one category of smart people. 
i was on track to being depressed just as much as i was on track to finish undergrad math in the first year. but when depression on one end of the scale, its hard to put anything against it. 
we always want more, but its hard to consider the opportunity cost in terms of what we already have. 

well, why cant my parents have tutored me in advanced math? because they never knew any STEM. 

why cant they have been professors? that would be nice, but they arent.

similarly, why cant i have had better counselors in high school? because they were shit.

why do some kids need to work to live and have no time for math? born into it, i suppose.

why, then, do some people not even have access to math books? …

when you’re born, a set of dice is cast. one to determine who your parents are, one for your income, one for your race, one for your genetics, one for your gender, one for your region, one for your sexuality, etc., and you get put in a track built from your immutable identities.

some are lucky with their tracks, and some arent. there are many points of failure and equally as many points of success (had my counselors been good, had i seen an advertisement for UM math camps, or had my mom not gotten an offer to come to the US, which would’ve been disastrous for me)

the failures you cant control, except to recognize them as bad luck and get out of the situation if you can. but the good things, you cant anticipate them, but the more times you roll the dice, the more you explore new things, the more likely it is that eventually you’ll get lucky.
