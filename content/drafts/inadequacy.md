### inadequacy
```md
Three-thousand-seven-ty three  
nights ago, I forgot about the pillow  
pressed against my face called  
inadequacy, forgot those were _my_ hands  
on the other side wringing themselves  
over whether or not I was any good,  
at anything, to anyone, forgot— 

The meaning of the word "subjective":  
everything is in my head, falling  
   down  
      the  
         stairs  
             of  
comparisons which aren't good  
for you, or so they say,  
instead of saying you're average they  
say it's subjective so you'd forget—

by watching sports or  
going to concerts or 
getting a ph.d in mathematics,  
praying to god or I guess these days  
all we need is a phone and to  
do nothing until we forget.
