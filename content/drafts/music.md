i've procrastinated writing this blog for a long time — it first appeared as my final project in psychology, then sporadic thoughts jot down in notes.app, and recently it's turned more and more into an obsession and [:an integral part of identity for me.](#identity)

as i child, i did not know about music.
in elementary and middle school, i'd listen to imagine dragons, or whatever was on radio then, and nocopyrightsounds (NCS) edm tracks on youtube. 
i didn't improve much in high school.
it was still a lot of pop, emo pop, same old songs to circle the world for a few weeks and fade from existence.
few people my age probably realized it then, as is the general rule of fashion, but in retrospect, some of those songs _really sucked._ 

toward the end of high school i was listening to a lot of old rock [(my playplist)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18hYMEzZIZJLOtI6HolXqw?si=70c39ed06ab941ad). 
my reasoning was simple: [:the best songs survive the test of time in a way that most pop songs dont](#bad-pop). 
but good songs are being produced now — now more than ever do small, independent artists have the ability to publish their music — the question is: how do you find the songs that will still be good decades from now?
music is like a lifelong companion, at minimum in the sense that you can lean on them in hard times, so how do you ensure, to the extent that is possible, that you've chosen well? 
do you pick the most well-liked? the most relatable? saddest? happiest? 

as i got older (you age quicker after high school), this thought kept cropping up in random corners of thought.
the similarity between music and friendship.

i couldn't sleep, so i made my way to a bench by the lake (there are many here, in michigan), and am now writing this here. 
its really dark, so it takes a bit getting used, dropping my guard against any noises coming from behind me.
it terrifies me to explore unknown physical spaces, so ofc when my friends played phasmophobia i volunteered to sit out, and i almost never leave the submarine when its dark in our subnautica world. 

fortunately, my caution for exploring does not extend into the realm of [:random theories.](#music-classification)

in my spotify there are two types of playlists: playlists for vibe, and playlists for occasion. 
"Sunshowers" is a vibe playlist, and songs in it have to be upbeat, high tonal range, and have either strong melodic intrumentals, layered vocals, or both. 
they're songs i listen to when im happy or want to be. 
there's "Headpopper", which is for working or raving (surprising how aural stimulation helps with both); "头疯～兜风", which is chinese wordplay for "head crazy ~ catching wind driving"; or "Perform Ejection Manoeuvre" which makes life brighter when its going well and takes me out of it when its not. 

i bring this all up because im proud of my playlist names, but also to say that perhaps, like music, there are people for vibes and people for occassions, especially people for different vibes.
maybe some are "ejection" people, maybe some are "sunshowers" people, maybe some are "headpopper" people, maybe this is an old idea that i havent been able to internalize until now, when it's linked to music.

i'd like to think that there are people who can be "ejection" AND "headpopper" AND "sunshowers" AND "zaza lounge" AND blahblah, and i've certainly tried that before, though in my experience it hasn't yet worked out.

people are more complex than songs <small class='whisper'>
(citation needed).
</small>
firstly, you can't just pick people. they have to pick you, too, and sometimes that's the hard part. 
songs also dont change, but people do, and it can be disorienting/uncomfortable to get to know them all over again.

but that's beside the point.
i've noticed that when i perceive people as inauthentic now, it isn't like in middle school or high school where they talk behind your back or straight up lie to you.
it's masking. masking their true feelings with jokes or with tears, which in turn makes me prone to take what they say at face value.
you have to play at guessing what they mean when they say certain things. 

i could try to come up with a classification scheme to try to organize people, and to try to make it as unbiased in regards to traits i favor vs. dislike.
one use for classification would've been to sort people into "playlists", but most people have a pretty accurate sense of when people are similar, so it's unnecessary unless you wanted to write about it.
another reason why you might want to classify something is that it forces you to define a bunch of traits that you care about, as well as ways to try to measure those traits in other people.
but i think this is unlikely to work because people are _so hard to gauge_. 


meanwhile, music can be shallow, or it can be negative, and toxic, but that is all clear from simply listening to it. 
different people might assign different traits to a song, but once assigned the traits rarely changes. 

- try to come up with a classification scheme
- why should we want to classify people? what's the point? i want to also propose a paradigm for choosing friends.

i think people tend to lose courage as they get older. they prefer to play it safe. they also get better at lying discreetly.
many people may have reached a saturation point for number of friendships that can be meaningfully maintained. 
to be honest, i cant decide how i feel about this. 
maybe just another thing in life that cant be optimized.

# :x identity

increasingly i find myself letting the kind of music we listen to speak for the similarities we share. 
im probably wrong for this. 
but being proactively vulnerable to other people, as promising as the idea of it once was to me, no longer seems worth the time or effort (i say this now, but it is likely i'm in the downswing of a vulnerability craze and will equilibrialize[^1] to a higher point later on)

stalking each other's music library is just a lot easier. 


# :x bad pop

examples:
- i don't listen to circles by post malone anymore, even though i think everyone regarded it pretty highly at the time.
- "levitating" by dua lipa has finally faded out.
- "stay" by the kid laroi? — sorry if this offends you, but that song was never good.


# :x music classification

this has nothing to do with the main idea of the blog and you can safely skip this, but i propose the following attributes:
color (bright, moody, mellow, dark, relaxed), variance (tonal & timbre), rhythm, drums, hardness (vocal and instrumental), energy level, progression (flat, step, plateau, ramp) 

my favorite music has strong melodic instrumentals and interesting, often layerd, vocals. solid bassline is cherry on top. they’re typically have strong tempo sense, and are cheerful. the vibe is a cool, sunny afternoon spent on the porch chatting and working. 

the other class of music is characterized by piccato, medium energy, usually minor, with soft instruments and dominated by staccato vocals. big range in the melody. this gives a vobe which i label as “sneaky”. 

if there are heavier vocals (especially if laid with effects) and moderately heavy instrumentation, this is pretty much the region of indie rock. some of the more mellow songs from the strokes go here. i have a playlist for these and songs softer than this which didnt make the “sneaky” category. my playlist for this vibe is called “moppy”

i make separate playlists for both vibes and occassions. energies range from the most mellowdramatic to latin pop, so depending on my mood and state of life i dont listen to some playlists for months at a time. 

im still building my high energy playlist, so right now my highest energy playlist is “Perform Ejection Manoeuvre”. vocals and instrumentals are heavy, with moderate to strong beats. when life is going well, they’re *really* good, and when things are rough they take me out of the cockpit for a bit. ejection it takes u higher

the final vibe is loungy, like frank sinatra level chill. there’s some nostalgia-esque music mixed in here, as well as some genuinely nostalgic music. these excel when played as low-volume background music. naturally they have soft, prominent vocals, a  moderate to weak rhythm sense. however, there are also some louder songs here to inject some music into the function. the playlist is “Sinatra’s zaza club”, and is great for setting a relaxed social scene.
