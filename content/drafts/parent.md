Is it a characteristically Asian experience to hate one, or both, of your parents? 
To have the urge to write vindictively about them, hoping that one day you will become famous enough for this piece to fall into their hands, and condemn them to a lifetime of guilt and shame?

Dear Mom,

Will I come back for the long break?— No, probably not. 
As things stand, I don't think I'll ever go back there voluntarily.

See, logically, I know that I am the center of your world. 
I sense that hidden amidst all the shaming, and the questioning, and pissing me off, there is — somehow, somewhere, inexplicably — love.
But I have my own world to attend to, a world disjoint from yours, and in my hubris I dare proclaim myself the sole expert on this subject.
Yet always, _always_, the underlying implication that I cannot be entrusted to myself. 

Do you still remember when you cut my hair? When I felt the ugliest I've ever been my whole life, and all you would say was that it was not you who was at fault. 
You tried your best, after all.

It was never just about the hair, mom — I mean, it was, for those weeks when I permanently flipped my phone's camera and ducked under mirrors — but more than that, what any child wants is just the freedom and support to be themselves. 
To be seen, as a curator sees a museum art piece.
And heard, like an answered prayer. 

A prayer, yes, because for so much of our lives, you were our deity. 
There is no force on Earth more powerful than a mother's love, so they say.

I've heard so many quotes and folktales about your love, but through these years I can't help but suspect, that while other children got love, I got stories of love.
Unconditional, except for a constant reminder of enormous debt.
How unreasonable it would be of me to ask you to stop meddling in my elections, you are the primary stakeholder, after all.

Best,

Sometimes you want someone to know that you became you in spite of them.
Like, "Look, you had no effect over me. Your influence was nothing to me."
This is, however, impossible when it comes to parents.
It's like radiation, and the best we can often do is get away from the source.

My friend Lia sent me this today:

> why does walking past my father in the kitchen feel like seeing a childhood bestfriend on the street?  
> the nod that says 'i knew you, but i don't think i need to anymore'

Maybe if we imagined our relationship with our parents as a sitcom, and stop taking our grievances so gravely. 
It's at least a little bit funny, how the universe sometimes insists that two complete strangers eat food that was cooked on the same stove, in bowls washed by the same hands.

Dear Dad,

Trust me when I say that I was really hungry that night.
In my hunger, I wandered to the kitchen in search of some strawberry ice cream, and it was there that I found you, standing there in front of the fridge in your llama pajamas. 

In your hand was the pint of ice cream I climbed out of bed for. 
You didn't see me, I think, for I might've been hiding in the walls.
And I pretended not to see you, as well, except to observe how naturally your eyes swept over my little spot in the wall. 
I dared not call out your name, to ask for a portion of my ice cream, for what if your ears perked up but you didn't hear me? 

I am not a ghost yet.

I returned to my bedroom empty-handed, too hungry to sleep.
On the bedside table is the watch you gave me for my 12th birthday.

"To keep you punctual."

I turned it over in my hand, and put it in my mouth gingerly.
It tasted a little like old attic, and more oily than I would've liked, but I chewed on it thoughtfully.
When that was done, I reached for another, and then another. 

In my infinite hunger, I ate piece-by-piece everything you ever gave me.
I ate the leather wallet you got me when I turned 16. 
I ate the mug that says "This mug is a hug from dad".
They tasted mostly of nothing, and I think I was a little disappointed by this. 
I ate my glasses, the cord bracelet on my wrist, and all the bad jokes you've ever made. 
They all turned to air when I bit down.
I hate the way you turned into air when I needed you (that was a freudian slip, I meant "ate").
Ate your fights with mother, ate the obsession with your career, ate through the way you want to control my life. 
It was disgusting and vile, bitter to the senses, but I kept putting in more and more, and everything had conglomerated into a mushy ball, pushing against my cheeks with bits of leather and blood spilling out. 

I wanted to throw up — but couldn't. 

...

Then, I woke up. 
There was nothing in my mouth but the remnant memory of something bitter. 

"Bad dream?" your eyebrows seemed to ask.

_Yes, but how can I tell you?_

"No, I just dreamed of ice cream."
