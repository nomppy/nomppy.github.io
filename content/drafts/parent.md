Is it a characteristically Asian experience to hate one, or both, of your parents? 
To have the urge to write vindictively about them, hoping that one day you will become famous enough for this piece to fall into their hands, and condemn them to a lifetime of guilt and shame?

I think so.

Dear Mom,

Will I come back for the long break?— No, probably not. 
As things stand, I don't think I'll ever go back there voluntarily.

See, logically, I know that I am the center of your world. 
I sense that hidden amidst all the shaming, and the questioning, and pissing me off, there is — somehow, somewhere, inexplicably — love.
But I have my own world to attend to, a world disjoint from yours, and in my hubris I dare proclaim myself the sole expert on this subject.
Yet always, _always_, the underlying implication that I cannot be entrusted to myself. 

Do you still remember when you cut my hair? When I felt the ugliest I've ever been my whole life, and all you would say was that it was not you who was at fault. 
You tried your best, after all, how unreasonable it would be of me to ask you to step back, look at the big picture, and for God's sake stop meddling in my affairs (both interpersonal and intrapersonal) like a politican.

It was never just about the hair, mom — I mean, it was, for those weeks when I permanently flipped my phone's camera and ducked under mirrors — but more than that, what any child wants is just the freedom and support to be themselves. 
To be seen, as a curator sees a museum art piece.
And heard, like an answered prayer. 

A prayer, yes, because for much of our lives, you were our deity. 
There is no force on Earth more powerful than a mother's love, so they say.
I've heard so many quotes and folktales about your love, but through these years I can't help but suspect, that while other children got love, I merely got stories of love.

My friend Lia showed me this quote today:

> why does walking past my father in the kitchen feel like seeing a childhood bestfriend on the street?  
> the nod that says 'i knew you, but i don't think i need to anymore'

Sometimes you want someone to know that you became you in spite of them.
You just want to say, "Look, you had no effect over me. Your influence was nothing to me."
This is, however, impossible when it comes to parents.
It's like radiation, and the best we can often do is get away from the source.

Dear Dad,
