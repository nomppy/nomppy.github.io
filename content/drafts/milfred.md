Dear Milfred, how is school? Will you be back home for Thanksgiving? It's been 5 months since I last saw you. I must be getting forgetful, because today I got up early and filled up the rosecan to water your Astrophyum ornatum, but I couldn't seem to find where I left it. A nice lady at the home later told me that I'd just watered it yesterday anyway, so not to worry.

Dear Milfred, how is school going? Have you applied for that prestigious scholarship? I have begun preparing a beautiful Thanksgiving feast here, and the staff are very keen on helping me with the knife. Will you come home this year? Your plants are looking as vibrant and healthy as the day you left for school.

Dear Milfred, please will you come home for Thanksgiving this year. It's been over 5 months since you've been gone.

Dear Milfred, I have moved into a very nice place with lots of other people my age. At first, they did not let me bring your plants here, but after I explained your situation to them they told me to not worry and that they would take care of everything for me.

Dear Milfred, will you come home soon? Today I saw on the TV an advertisement for a small college. They were bragging about a $60,000 starting salary for graduates. Do you think that's high?

Dear Milfred, I hope you are well, it's been nearly four months since you've been home. Don't worry about your plants, I am still taking care of them.

Dear Mrs. Clint, I am an acquaintance of Milfred's. He left several weeks ago to "search for his star" and left this phone in my possession. I'm just letting you know that I will sell his phone to the pawn shop if he doesn't return by Christmas.

Dear Milfred, will you be home for Christmas? I realized that it's possible I might have overreacted to your messages. I am all alone here. Please come home.

Milfred. Disrespecting me does not make you a good person. You grew up in a better environment than I did, what made that happen? I sacrificed myself for you to have a better life, not waste time and energy on things that don't matter. You shall not blame me and judge my life.

Mother â€” you have drowned her. Her roots are rotten because you drowned her. If you can kill a succulent, is there anything you can't kill? You don't understand me and you don't try to. You don't understand that money is not the most important thing and that I hate my studies. And now that you've cut off my roots I don't know what to do at all.

Milfred. Your cactus has rotten roots and I am throwing it out. May you learn to spare your mother a fraction of the care you have for plants.

Dear mother, you don't know how to care for them. The Astrophytum ornatum mustn't be watered until the soil is completely dry. She was sickly and wheezing when I left, and I worry for her.

Dear Milfred, you shall focus on your accounting first and foremost. Think about what's better for you in the long term, not now. If you spend time taking care of useless plants you lose the chance to make hundreds/thousands times the money you can make in the future. I will water your plants every other day.

Dear mother, it is very lonely here. The people are unkind, uncaring, and my schoolwork feels meaningless. I wake up feeling like the frail, hollow trunk of an old oak with fungi gnawing at my core, and that a fierce gale or a spiteful shove from any passing human would be enough to topple my existence. I am standing day after day only by chance. Please send at least my Astrophytum ornatum. It reminds me of stars and always gives me hope.

Dear Milfred, you must apply soon for the scholarship. Sorry to turn you down, but you may not bring your plants to school. You can have them when you begin working. You shall focus on your studies now.

Dear mother, school is okay. I have not applied to the scholarship. It's a lot of pressure around here and every day feels like a blur. I'm beginning to wonder what the point of all of it is. I don't think I'll be able to go home for Thanksgiving. Will you please send me some of my plants?
