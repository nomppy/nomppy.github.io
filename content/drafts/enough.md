### (not) enough

i am the president of a special club.
it's called the:  
male asian-americans who are also  
writers and physics majors and poets  
and chinese, but also american, and  
a pianist who programs and sometimes sings.

i ought to change that name.  

when i was 9 i moved to ohio  
where i was deemed not american enough,  
so they called me locker boy, locker boy,  
for all the times their bone-headed asses  
tried to shove mine in a locker but  
there wasn't enough  
room. and at home i oftentimes had  
the room to myself but no room  
for anything else.  

_alone, but not lonely,_  
i tell myself, _external_  
_social validation will_  
_never be enough._ yet i  
was not loved enough as a child  
or something so as much as  
i want to love someone else i  
realize i am not sexy enough,  
not gentle enough, not caring enough,  
for love to come and stay.  

i am not a poet cuz if i were,  
i'd write with breathtaking imagery  
and i am not a scientist cuz if i were,  
i wouldn't be here writing this poem,  
and i am not american enough cuz i dont  
party or eat salad or conform enough and i am  
not asian enough cuz i am not smart enough,  
talented enough, loyal enough, straight enough,  
fast enough to catch every expectation and  
balanced enough to not fall on my ass.  

enough! what will ever be enough?  
not enough is good enough  
for the not enough club.  
every human is welcome to  
the not enough club.
