Dear Cupid,


I've been thinking about love a lot lately — what is it? How does it work? How do we find it? The answer is I don't know. These days I feel like I hardly know anything. I used to think that I would know love when I feel it, but now I'm not so sure.

I had love, once. When I was in grade school I once held a boys hand as we walked home from school together. 
Our walk was short — just the distance from our bus stop to his house — but on the way we would pass by the Harbingers' house. 
The Harbingers loved nature, and this you could tell just by looking at their front lawn, which was more like a garden, actually. 
The old couples must've taken extreme care to litter their yard with the most exotic and vibrant fauna, and the whole property rested under the canopy of dense tree leaves, planted serendipitously, and could be mistaken for a vintage log cabin in the Smoky Mountains. 
The house itself was made entirely out of wood save for the foundation, which was mossy stone. 
Luscious, green ivy crawled up one side, almost covering the wall entirely, and wrapped itself around the chimney. 
Walking past their house made you feel like you were in a secret forest, or at least that's how it made me feel.

The Harbingers' house was undoubtedly my favorite part of the whole walk home. 
We'd slow our pace to barely an amble and stop before their house, his hand in mine. 
We'd pause there for a minute, and then we'd keep walking. 
Only once we've left the house behind would we chat excitedly about when we were going to get married and how our English teacher, Ms. Finnegan, had see-through hair and how we wanted a house just like the Harbingers'. 
We never talked when passing by the Harbingers' house. 
It was our secret, and we thought that making any noise would give it away. 
Secrets are romantic like that, I suppose. 
The boy was a secret also — my secret. 
We held hands only under the cover of the Harbingers' trees, and as soon as we passed it we would have to let go. 
Secrets are romantic like that.

When the Harbingers died, I didn't even notice. 
It was two months later, when the unruly grass spilled onto the road and vegetation covered the entire house, that their grandchildren swooped in and took control of the property. 
The grandchildren were stockbrokers. 
Efficient, hard-working people. 
Within the week they'd found an interested tenant, who kindly requested that the "shrubbage" be removed, and within the month, the old Harbingers' house was now just another old house on the block. 
With our cover gone, we stopped holding hands, and soon after we found that we ran out of things to say, until finally I rode our bus an extra stop to avoid the awkward silence and walked home alone.

These days I often wonder, did I have reasons for falling in love, or did I fall in love first and came up with the reasons later? 
Was it even him that I was in love with, or was it just the house? 
Isn’t love just a bunch of chemicals shooting around in your brain? — chemicals engineered by your genes to make you feel good and thereby continuing to make more copies of your genes. 
It’s a horrible trick that my genes have played on me, because I don’t have a single idea on how I might find love, and if I’m even in control of who I fall in love with.
I remember how badly he wanted to not be a secret. 
He didn’t think secrets were romantic at all. 
We humans are silly — falling in love knowing it must inevitably end in heartbreak.

So you see, I used to think secrets were romantic, but now I’m not so sure. 
Now I’m not sure I’d recognize love even if it was right in front of me or if I could ever be in love again, or if I did fall in love if it would ever be more real than boosted levels of serotonin and dopamine. 
I’m not sure at all, at least where another person is concerned. 
Do you know where love lives and how I could find it? 



Sincerely,
Yours
