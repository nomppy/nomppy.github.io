# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Like [notion](https://notion.so)[^1], but better. 

I think I have ADD or ADHD or Alzeihmer's or something, because the amount of times I make a useful document in Obsidian and forget that it exists after not using it for a while is _insane_. 
For instance, using the tags feature, I made a page to aggregate all the quotes I'd gathered. It was a nice feature. Then sometime later I made a separate document where I wrote down a set of quotes...

<div class='img-caption'> so many things... all the time </div>

# Google calendar

Self-evident.

# Outlooks's schedule send feature

In case you are uninformed, in Outlook, you can write an email and schedule it to be sent the next morning, or if you write emails on the weekend (ew gross i'd never do that), for Monday.

Do I ever remember to use it? No. But I still live by it.

# Naps

Ever since I cut down my nighttime sleep, it's gotten impossible to make it through an entire day awake. 
In this economy, it's impossible to get through a whole day awake anyway.

The key to taking a good nap is to actually NOT fall asleep - if you fall asleep you spend more time trying to wake up. 
If you feel sufficiently tired, you can enter [hypnagogia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) almost immediately, and wake up in 10 minutes refreshed without falling into deeper sleep.

# [Onelook.com](https://onelook.com)
_Ack-_ what was that word for "strong hatred" that ends with "ma"?

<article-image src='anathema.png' alt='a screenshot of Onelook thesaurus returning a list of words which mean strongly hated, finding anathema'> </article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> it's a real word, a great word </div>

# Z-lib
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüìö: Since the original domain went down, you now need to use [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org) to access its `.onion` domain (I won't tell you how to do this, but you can look it up).

# Blogs 

Paul Graham's[^who?] essays contain some of my favorite advice on writing:

- [Write Simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html)
- [Write Like You Talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)

And some of the benefits/effects of writing ([Putting Ideas Into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)).

Other, more generally direction-oriented essays that are also pretty good:

- [Life Is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)
- [Earnestness](http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html)
- [Although of course you end up becoming yourself](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/choosing-to-become-yourself/)

These form some of my core beliefs and I frequently go back to them in times of crisis, indecision, or uncertainty.

A few more, for my sake:

- [finding the right people](https://nicoles.substack.com/p/finding-the-right-people)
- [You don't need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/)
- [it's okay to not know](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/it-is-okay-to-not-know/)

# Music

I grew up [playing piano](https://www.kennethsun.net/posts/c-sharp-minor), but never really listening to music, and then not interacting with many people meant my music library was stagnant for the longest time.
Now it's loosely linked to my identity and holds significance in my life.

Plugs (my playlists that you should go like and also follow me on spotify because i need clout):

- [dancing down the sidewalk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0JKgiTGaaXoUpfLvEPd7YM?si=e0f52fa686f54dd5) (up-beat, mood amplifier)
- [moppy](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6wNJphAVy0JMnc01R4huU1?si=d9e08470e34846de); not what it sounds like, more sentimental than mopey.
- [sad karaoke](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2PiczkgGSNVrgU47dDLaTW?si=5205a36262124e8a) (exactly what it sounds like)

I generally go over my playlists every other month or so to update them (remove vestige songs, make more categories, etc.).
I think it's interesting how different songs represent different moods, which evolves over time.
There are almost no pop songs in my favorite playlists, because even if I add them, they tend to live very ephemeral lives in the playlist (i.e. I get tired of them very quickly).

# Poems
> Tell all the truth but tell it slant.
> - _Emily Dickinson_

- [Invictus](https://poets.org/poem/invictus). This is really definitive of my preferred mentality in life.
- [The View from Halfway Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1_EBSlnDlU). This is a scene from [Bojack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman); contains suicide.
- [This Be The Verse](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse). Generational trauma. Also funny.
- [I measure every grief I meet](https://poets.org/poem/i-measure-every-grief-i-meet-561) - Emily Dickinson
- [Hope is the thing with feathers](https://poets.org/poem/hope-thing-feathers-254) - Emily Dickinson

# Books

### [The Little Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) (ou Le Petit Prince si tu veut)

> ‚ÄúAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.‚Äù 

How could you not like this book? Do you hate life itself?
The Little Prince is a reminder to live.

> ‚ÄúI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more. It is such a secret place, the land of tears.‚Äù

### [The Humans by Matt Haig](https://www.amazon.com/Humans-Novel-Matt-Haig/dp/1476730598)

This book is just so damn quotable and heartwarming.
It's about an alien sent to Earth to assassinate a math professor who made a significant discovery.

- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. It‚Äôs the warm bits that matter.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe news should start with mathematics, then poetry, and move down from there.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever be afraid of telling someone you love them. There are things wrong with your world, but an excess of love is not one.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAs a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you‚Äôd be happy to die doing.‚Äù

### [Mathematics for Human Flourishing](https://www.francissu.com/flourishing) by Francis Su

Easy to read, thoughtful, inspiring, and suitable for everyone (even if you think you don't like math). 
It's a philosophy book written by a math professor, if you will.
There is very little math involved here, and it's very welcoming!


[^1]: to be honest, notion is a more beginner-friendly alternative and probably better suited to you. I've used Notion extensively as well, and it's still definitely a very powerful tool for organization.
[^who?]: if you are unaware, he co-founded the YCombinator, which is a start-up incubator which funded things like Airbnb.
