## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Like [notion](https://notion.so)[^1], but better. 

I think I have ADD or ADHD or Alzeihmer's or something, because the amount of times I make a useful document in Obsidian and forget that it exists after not using it for a while is _insane_. 
For instance, using the tags feature, I made a page to aggregate all the quotes I'd gathered. It was a nice feature. Then sometime later I made a separate document where I wrote down a set of quotes...

<div class='img-caption'> so many things... all the time </div>

# Google calendar

Self-evident.

# Outlooks's schedule send feature

In case you are uninformed, in Outlook, you can write an email and schedule it to be sent the next morning, or if you write emails on the weekend (ew gross i'd never do that), for Monday.

Do I ever remember to use it? No. But I still live by it.

# Naps

Ever since I cut down my nighttime sleep, it's gotten impossible to make it through an entire day awake. 
In this economy, it's impossible to get through a whole day awake anyway.

The key to taking a good nap is to actually NOT fall asleep - if you fall asleep you spend more time trying to wake up. 
If you feel sufficiently tired, you can enter [hypnagogia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) almost immediately, and wake up in 10 minutes refreshed without falling into deeper sleep.

# [Onelook.com](https://onelook.com)
_Ack-_ what was that word for "strong hatred" that ends with "ma"?

<div class='img-caption'> it's a real word, a great word </div>

# Z-lib
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüìö: Since the original domain went down, you now need to use [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org) to access its `.onion` domain (I won't tell you how to do this, but you can look it up).

# Blogs 

Paul Graham's[^who?] essays contain some of my favorite advice on writing:

- [Write Simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html)
- [Write Like You Talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)

And some of the benefits/effects of writing ([Putting Ideas Into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)).

Other, more generally direction-oriented essays that are also pretty good:

- [Life Is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)
- [Earnestness](http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html)
- [Although of course you end up becoming yourself](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/choosing-to-become-yourself/)

These form some of my core beliefs and I frequently go back to them in times of crisis, indecision, or uncertainty.

# Music

I grew up [playing piano](https://www.kennethsun.net/posts/c-sharp-minor), but never really listening to music, and then not interacting with many people meant my music library was stagnant for the longest time.
Now it's loosely linked to my identity and holds significance in my life.

Plugs:

- [dancing down the sidewalk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0JKgiTGaaXoUpfLvEPd7YM?si=e0f52fa686f54dd5) (up-beat, mood amplifier)
- [moppy](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6wNJphAVy0JMnc01R4huU1?si=d9e08470e34846de); not what it sounds like, more sentimental than mopey.
- [sad karaoke](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2PiczkgGSNVrgU47dDLaTW?si=5205a36262124e8a) (exactly what it sounds like)

I generally go over my playlists every other month or so to update them (remove vestige songs, make more categories, etc.).
I think it's interesting how different songs represent different moods, which evolves over time.
There are almost no pop songs in my favorite playlists, because even if I add them, they tend to live very ephemeral lives in the playlist (i.e. I get tired of them very quickly).



[^1]: to be honest, notion is a more beginner-friendly alternative and probably better suited to you. I've used Notion extensively as well, and it's still definitely a very powerful tool for organization.
[^who?]: if you are unaware, he co-founded the YCombinator, which is a start-up incubator which funded things like Airbnb.
