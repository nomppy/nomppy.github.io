i’ve just had a particularly bad week of college — probably the worst i’ve ever had. 
the prof for math 454, whose ethnicity is of no intrigue (he's russian), gave two lectures that left me and everyone else at the table more confused than we've ever been in math.
numerous hours spent psetting to exponentionally diminishing returns — the 6 of us, most math majors, deep in the trenches from lecture 1.

we’ll get through it, maybe. but the truth is that a mere one week into the year, and im *already* incredibly overwhelmed. with this class, with other classes, too, with the loom of research and the billion clubs i signed up for at festifall, with housing issues, lack of internet, cell service. 

there are just _so many things to do._

it occurred to me most of the way through the week that i was stressed and anxious about how the term would evolve, in a way that complaining about each thing alone wouldnt help. 
i had to step back and look at everything as a whole. i had to write.

somewhere on my computer is a file named `lessons.md`, which is a dated log of things i’ve learned “the hard way”. sadly, some lessons are frequent visitors. “blind stubbornness in the face of problems” being one of them. 

still, when i remember this file exists and am reminded of my bad habit. i can consciously try to avoid repeating the same mistake. this kind of writing is reflective, and meta, but usually helpful.

another kind is the kind im writing now, written with the intent of being read by someone else. 
it’s meant to be intimate, conversational, maybe semi-helpful, but more often than not it’s just me telling you something about myself. i think when you read what someone wrote, you always come away knowing more about that person, whether they intended it or not.

for example, i write a good amount and make them public on my website, and sometimes my friends would read them, or strangers.
because such a candid side of you shows through writing, which isnt always easy to show in real life — and it is the *real* you, i would argue — some of my friends know me a lot better than i know them. 
i might even know better, say, jk rowling, or rupi kaur, or the author of “the little prince”, than i know some of my friends.

i find that to be both odd and amazing. 
odd, because i know so much about antoine de saint-exupery without having ever met him, yet know comparatively little of people who i see everyday. 
but amazing, because there’s absolutely nothing standing in the way of friends writing to be read by each other.

in fact, i think one of the biggest arguments for writing and reading is to keep up, and be kept up with, by ones’ friends.

other benefits of writing apply, but its all unimportant compared to the very ability to actually **see** someone, and to **be seen**.

_do you see what i'm saying? have you ever thought about this? here, have a think about this. let's think about this together._

my relationship with writing is a complicated one. 
i like doing it, but im really no good.
i love thinking through ideas, but i hate having to write them down.

_what could i write that people would want to read?_

i don't know. that's too much thinking. so sometimes i resort to talking about writing instead of actually doing it. 

oops- here i am again

here is a little game you can try the next time you're drinking with some friends.
it's called "unscripted", and how it works is that somebody starts off telling a story about whatever they want, then going around in a circle, each person has to tell a story, using the previous ones as a jumping-off point.
it doesnt have to be a funny story, but bonus points for doing so.

now, say the first story is about "the time i went to a themepark and the mascot chased me across the park", then the next story has to be related to themeparks, or mascots, or being chased. 
then if the next story is "the time i shit my pants waiting in line at a themepark", then the next-next person gets the additional jump-off point of "shitting pants". 

the idea is that eventually, someone will run out of/can't remember real stories, at which point they'll be forced to make something up (hence "unscripted"[^1]) 
you can call bs on each other's stories, and whoever loses the bluff, drinks. 

the idea for this game came in my 12th grade writing class, where i read something along the lines of "what does it matter if it really happened? it's about what you _believe_ happened". 
it came from a famous fiction writer justifying why fiction, even more than nonfiction, has the power to change minds.

> I used to have an English teacher named Mr. Stelmaszek, or Mr. Stel for short. Whenever he felt like it, usually several times per week, he would pause in the middle of whatever he’s teaching to tell us a story from his life. I learned a little English, sure, but mostly I learned about him driving a boat up and down the Mediterranean, searching for sunk ships. 
> It seemed improbable for all these interesting, meaningful things to happen to one person. So I thought he either had the secret power to make his life interesting, or that he was making it all up.
> 
> One day, I asked him if the stories he tells us in class really happened or if he made them up, and he said, “Real or made-up, does it matter? My stories could’ve been just has well been about aliens in another world.” Then he pointed to his head and said, “It happened up here. That’s all that matters.”

the first ironic thing is that this didn't come from a famous writer, but was part of an anecdote i wrote in grade 12.
if it didn't fool you, then you're doing better than my writing class.
the second ironic thing is that the original anecdote was completely made up as well.
i did hear the original idea coming from a fiction writer, but for the life of me i can't find the quote. 

to be clear, i'm not advocating for presenting outright fabrication as fact. 
if you lie, you should never say that it wasn't a lie.
i just think that "reality" is taken too seriously by too serious people. 

so that's the game. i hope you try it.


writing, and by proxy engaging the imagination, is a kind of meditation. 
and meditation, in turn, is preparation for death.

when you meditate or dream or write, or simply let yourself be immersed into a book, your mind is not there.
you might still be conscious, but it is not the same conscious that you usually are — you're not who you usually are.

i say "usually" with the very loose sense that this is who the kind of consciousness we need to have for much of daily life: filling out applications, picking up knowledge, making decisions about where to go, who to like, what to say. 
it's productive and perpetually occupied and filled with all the received notions from our culture and environments growing up. 
it _loves_ to look itself in the eyes and say, "This is me. I am the 'I'. I am in charge."
and it would love to remain in charge forever and ever, being all thinky and worry.
but if you've ever read a really good poem, dangled over a really nice ledge, traced the raindrops down a window, or, like, been asleep ever, then you know the _Id_ is not always in charge.

in the last episode of "the midnight gospel" (which i hate netflix for cancelling), the characters talk about meditation, how to get into a state of presence, and one of them says:

> **M**: You can move back and forth between these dimensions of ordinary consciousness, and something that is out of space and time.  
> **D**: Right.. and that thing that is out of space and time-  
> **M**: -is more real than the mental constructs-  
> **D**: That's your true identity  
> **M**: It's what we've been talking about. Cause all of that, is just stuff you've learned throughout your life. Because of the family you were born in and the situations you had, the circumstances you were in and your natural proclivities. 

i've tried to do thir exercise, by the way, and you _do_ feel something different. 
i don't know if it's "out of space and time", but i would definitely say that i was "out of myself".

it is maybe an unfortunate fact that ordinary consciousnesses are what's mostly seen as the "right" state of mind,
which reminds me of the oppression of morning people over night people. 
somehow, being nonfunctional past 9pm is laudable, but being nonfunctional before 9am is a cardinal sin.
personally, i think that while ordinary consciousness is required for a lot of things, it just plain sucks the rest of the time and doesn't know when to quit.

your consciousness hinders your subconscious, constantly filters it, which is awful for creativity. 
there's such a small thing that makes my point: i write these blogs in a markdown file, and i used to name the file whatever i thought the blog would be about. 
one time, i'd decided to merge two ideas together and couldn't think of a proper filename after a few minutes, so i just gave up and named it 'idk'. 
it was such a small change, but it made writing the rest of the piece _so much easier_. 
i wasn't mentally filtering every thought to see if they were on topic. 
i just _wrote_, and it was much better that way.

there are loads of stories of creatives and inventors who've benefited from shutting out their ordinary consciousness so the real ideas could come through.
edison [is known](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thomas-edisons-naps-inspire-a-way-to-spark-your-own-creativity/) to have dozed off to sleep holding a big ball in his hands, whenever he got stuck on a problem. 
the best ideas would come to him as he was falling asleep, and his hands relaxing and droping the ball would wake him up so he could write it down.
[dali and aristotle, too](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/27/from-aristotle-to-einstein-a-brief-history-of-power-nappers#:~:text=Salvador%20Dalí%2C%20in%20his%2050,ensuing%20clang%20ensures%20instant%20revival), had the habit of power napping as a way to come up with ideas.
and some people at mit are trying to build a device to [harvest](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/sleep-creativity/overview/#faq-how-does-dormio-work) these dream-wakefulness boundary ideas

a quote from one of the above articles says:
> Now, more than 100 years later, scientists have repeated the trick in a lab, revealing that the famous inventor was on to something. People following his recipe tripled their chances of solving a math problem. The trick was to wake up in the transition between sleep and wakefulness, just before deep sleep.

i, too, used this trick in my geometry class last term — whenever i got stuck on a problem, i just laid down for a quick 10 minute thinking nap, and solved many problems this way. 
it is very important to not _actually_ fall asleep, because you'll forget everything you were thinking.
