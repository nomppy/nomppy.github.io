title: Being Bored
description: & what to do about it
category: blogs
---

for the past several days, i've been _incredibly bored_. 
i've just gotten back home from my summer internship near chicago, where i was also frequently bored, but at least there was lots to do outside of work to distract me from boredom.
back home, for some reason everyone is busy working, so i'm bored _and_ with nothing to distract me. 
i wake up late, do nothing memorable for most of the day, pass out at around 2 watching stuff on my phone, and do it again the next day.
the weird thing is that it's not like i have nothing to do: i could study math, study compsci, physics, or read one of the million books on my reading list, all things which i absolutely _crave doing_ during the school year but can't for the lack of time.

i've been trying to write my blog about music, but as soon as i start i found that i have virtually nothing thoughtful to say, or that each sentence comes out like squeezing the last remaining toothpaste from a tube. 
these aren't thoughts i usually face in writing, but i guess that's what i get for trying to write through boredom. 
then it occurred to me that i ought to write about the boredom itself, so here we are.

to begin with, i think we need to make a necessary distinction between kinds of boredom.
for now, let's say there are two kinds.
there is the kind where you exit a tv show halfway through, and there is the kind where you do nothing all day because nothing is appealing to generate enough motivation to do it.

the first kind of boredom is healthy boredom, because it's helpful.
it tells you to watch a different show because this one sucks, or tells you to leave the party, hangout with people, etc. 
this kind of boredom says, "you're wasting your life. go do something else."

meanwhile the second kind of boredom says, "that seems boring. i dont wanna do that. thats too much work."
or when you finally DO do something â€” you get bored quickly and want to stop. 
it's a state of being that's so _unbelivably unhelpful._

the first is a feeling that helps you adjust to doing something else that will bring you joy, and the second is a state of existing that sucks the joy out of every activity and stops you from doing anything.
here, i want to answer a few questions about the second kind of boredom. namely: 
1. how does it arise? what causes it?
2. how do you fix it?

### boredom works like this. 
or at least, this is how i think it works.

- every activity has some intrinsic activation energy needed to initiate it, as well as some rate of energy consumption needed to sustain it
- **motivation** is how much energy you have to engage in activities
- each activity has a corresponding energy reward, which allows some activities to be self-sustaining and makes others to be draining.
- **satisfaction** is a subjective cognitive evaluation of how you've spent your energy, independent of the actual amount you have

boredom-1 happens when you feel like you have something more rewarding to do. 
but this can only happen if you have sufficiently high motivation. 
even if you're watching a shitty show, if you dont have enough motivation to do anything else, you might just get stuck watching the show. 
it's like if you're hungry and you want to get something to eat, but you only have $5 in your pocket. 
you'd like to eat real food, but junk fast food is the only thing you can afford. 
so you get the junk food, and you feel terrible about it but there's nothing else you can do. 
you don't have a choice.
you feel terrible, so you suck at your job, and you have no money, so you continue to feel terrible.

i think this is pretty much what happened to me, except i got sick one day and started feeling terrible that way.

the thing with motivation is that it comes from **anticipation of reward**.
maybe there are other sources, i dont know im just an armchair psychologist, but i think this is the main one for most people.
you do something, it makes you feel good, you like it, you're motivated to do it again because you anticipate it to be good.
so one cause for lack of motivation is the lack of dopamine. 
when dopamine levels are low in the brain, your brain struggles to anticipate feeling pleasure from an activity, so motivation is low.
i might start studying math anyway because i know, consciously, that i will start to enjoy it. 
usually the process of learning something interesting produces at least as much motivation as it consumes. 
but with an initial motivation deficit, it is such an expensive activity that it burns through all of my motivation before it has a chance to reach self-sustainability. 

a common thing that happens is i'll scroll on my phone for a couple hours or watch tv the whole aftermoon, and feel utterly exhausted afterwards. 
it's always been mysterious to me why this happens, because it's not like i've actually done anything at all.
in the past, i thought this was similar to the tiredness you feel when you oversleep. 
but now i think it's different, because when you oversleep there's a physiological reason why you feel tired, and generally its not the direct cause of low motivation.
the only explanation is that scrolling on tiktok or watching boring tv _does_ deplete energy, despite being mindlessly easy, and it uses more energy than it generates.

(it's well known from behavioral neuroscience that the reason gambling is so addictive is that it introduces chance into anticipation of reward. 
if you never gain the reward, then you stop wanting to do it. but if you always gain the reward, then you build up a tolerance against it.
lab testing on monkeys revealed that the highest dopamine spikes occurred when the reward was given 50% of the time, followed by 25% and 75% of the time, and least when 100% of the time.
the same mechanic which powers casinos and romantic situationships also powers short video algorithms, which explains why we keep going.)

### ok so... how do you fix it?

one option is to do drugs.
if a lack of dopamine is the issue, then a natural solution is to get more of it, either through caffeine or psychostimulants.
but you might become dependent on them, which is potentially bad.

the other way is harder. if we put all the things you can do on a spectrum ordered according to how much motivation is required to do them, and assume that currently you have 0 motivation. 
then what you need to do is pick a specific thing you want to do, then find a sequence of activities with strictly decreasing levels of motivation need, and do this sequence in reverse.
this way, you build up motivation gradually until you have enough to do what you want to do.
so i'd maybe start with something easy, like taking a walk or passively watching interesting youtube videos.
then i read something for a bit, or write a blog about how bored i am, watch more intense youtube videos, or meditate on something interesting.
if all goes well, this process would take around an hour, and im now ready to do stuff for real.

an easy way for me to tell if it's working is by how active my brain is. 
i think maybe turning the brain off was meant to be an optimization to conserve energy. 
when im out of the bored state, ideas come noticeably more frequent, thinking is more pleasurable, metabolism speeds up (tend to go to the bathroom more, get hungry), im generally happier and feel lighter.

**extra hacks for getting un-bored:**
- hide your phone, because having low dopamine makes you way more prone to distraction. turn off the wifi if you need to, get extensions to kick you off email, etc etc.
- go somewhere else, like the library. it'll stimulate your brain either through novelty or behavioral association to that location. 
- listen to energetic music (personally i use house edm). although this will only help with making you less distractable, not more motivated.
- lock yourself in a room with nothing else to do, because when there's literally nothing, the anticipation of any joy at all you'll get from studying or whatever you're doing in there will be magnified a thousand times.

in all my years of being bored, i can say for sure that the one thing which almost never works is waiting passively.
motivation does not regenerate passively!

i also want to add that ideally, one wouldn't get into this state at all. 
it's more natural and easier to wake up and start doing things so you don't drain your motivation battery and have to jump start it. 
sometimes it might be a good idea to just stop guilting yourself and take the day off, watch some tv, accept that it's an off day, so you can go to sleep happy and be ready the next day.
