description: words i always thought were too cheesy to say out loud

sometimes, you'd just like for the world to take a break from the irony. 
we don't always have to mask affection with hate and play stupid.
every once in a while, we can afford to stop being shy and say what we really mean to say, in earnest.

**1**: thank you for being there from the start, and seeing me through all the things i did.
i only hope that you didn't cringe as much as i do when i think back on them now. 

**x**: you were some of the best things that have ever happened to me, and there'll always be a piece of my soul with your mark on it.

**ap**: somehow you know so much about hair, and you tolerate my bullshit remarkably well every time. how thoughtful and gentlemanly of you.

**h**: knowing you is like watching a hurricane blow over a small tree, yet you remain smiling through the bashing of the wind, and that's what i really like about you.
but do go to therapy.

**a1**: sometimes the longest distances make for the closest friendships <3. you carry so much burden and i hope you're doing okay.
you should definitely go to therapy.

**a2**: campus always seemed a little less bright whenever you were away. 
you're humble and kind and so, so funny. it's a joy to just be around you.

**l**: i really don't know what would've came of me last year if it hadn't been for you.
you're the sort of person to come out to your parents in a game of two truths and a lie. you're smart and caring, albeit a little full of yourself, but when you're genuinely happy, i rejoice, and when you're sad, i'm sad too.
therapy, now.

**g**: you really are like the big sister i never had. you are always so busy all the time, but when we talk i can talk for hours on end. 

**m & n**: you'll probably laugh at me for writing this, but i know you will enjoy it in secret. 
you belong to the sorts of people who don't fall upon each other when you meet, but through the years your actions speak in loud volume. 
therapy recommended.

**kk**: you are so strong and supportive that sometimes i wonder if you aren't secretly a red sequoia.
i owe you for rescuing my self-esteem each time it was shattered.
