I was born with a body blanket – one of those fluffy bags that little children tuck themselves into, with zippers for their limbs. It's like a pillow for your body.

Its name was Beibei, which means "clam" or "shell" in Chinese. 
Indeed, it became my shell for many years. 
Beibei had fluffy, white fur that was soothing to stroke, and especially to wrap myself in.
It slid over my round stomach, behind the small of my back, and circled me round and round until it finally rested atop my shoulder.  

It stretched with me as I stretched taller and skinnier. It shrunk when my mom machine-washed it. For this reason, Beibei had to be hand-washed. 

My childhood proceeded smoothly. My guardian blanket kept me safe from physical harm, and whenever my stern grandmother started yabbing at me, it slammed shut like a clamshell to protect me. Even when Beibei wasn't with me, I felt its soft hand on my shoulder, ever present. 

When we came to America, Beibei was left behind. So, too, were the friends I played with, the games we played, the shops we frequented, the books I read, and places that I once remembered. 

Kids are awful people. I know this because I was a horrible kid. As a birthday present, I received a Lego set. Now the gem of the set was the electric motor which enabled things to move, and I loved it. But I was not the most careful child, because a couple of days after I got it, I broke one of the motors by trying to forcefully attach a wheel axle. Needless to say, I was devastated. 

A week later, I was at my friend's house, where we often hung out and did children activities together. I brought my Lego set, and as we were building one of the contraptions my friend discovered that he couldn't get his motor to work. I don't know what came over me, but I took it out of his hands and exclaimed, "It's... broken! You broke my motor!!" A huge fuss ensued where our parents got involved, and we stopped being friends for a long while. 

Without Beibei, all the cruelty of the other children scalded me with full-force. I didn't belong there. I'm an alien. I'm weird. My food is weird. My culture is weird. To blend in, I, too, became selfish and cruel. I forgot about the place where I came from, forgot about its books and games, forgot the people. I locked up the things that earned me torment at school into a little, mental box. If Beibei were there, it would've shielded me from the cruelty and the forgetting, but it wasn't, and soon it was locked away as well.


# Blowing by in the Autumn Wind

It's a Tuesday in October, my last fall of high school. The sun hangs brightly in a cloudless, blue sky, its radiance seemingly penetrating through my blinds. It's incredible that photons would shoot across 93 million miles and through the Earth's thick atmosphere, just to trouble me by producing glare on my monitor. I try to pin down my blinds, made restless by periodic gusts of wind, but I only manage to shift the glare from one region of the screen to another. 

I sigh. My last name might be Sun, but the sun and I don’t really get along. “Sorry for the glare,” I say.

"That's alright," my therapist says as their Zoom tile lights up, "By the way, do you go by Kenneth or Kenny?" they ask. If I'd anticipated this question being asked of me all the time, I would've chosen a different name.

"Either is fine."

"Alright, Kenneth, could you tell me a little about your childhood?"

✯✯✯

America smells different, was my first thought as my mom pulled into the driveway of our rental house in the suburbs of Dayton, Ohio. Suburbs don't exist where I'm from. There it's either big apartment complexes, built fast and high to support the demand of the exploding population, or farm houses so old and rural that a sewage system would be considered luxurious. Dayton, Ohio had a sewage system, but no towering skyscrapers, which was confusing to me. There was also grass — maybe that was why it smelled so different — sewage systems and grass.

My second thought was: Wow there are a lot of white people. In 2013, when I moved, Dayton's Asian population was only 2.2%, but they must've been cooped up in the neighboring counties, because I swear I never saw any of them. 

✯✯✯

I fidget with my pencil (it's a habit I've picked up over the years, fidgeting), tracing imaginary circles in the air. I like Zoom sessions: I can get away with fidgeting with anything as long as it's out of the camera's view, and I also don’t need to explain where I’m going to my mom. The only con is maybe that I'm sitting at my desk instead of laying on a comfortable couch. 

"It was pretty good, I guess." I say, "I was born in China, my parents got divorced when I was 3, I lived mostly with my mom and saw my dad on weekends. Then my mom wanted to move us to America, which my dad didn't like. She wanted me to get a better education, but he thought that Americans were stupid. They didn't see things the same, obviously, that's why they divorced, but my mom had custody, so we came." 

"And... What was Ohio like for you? You mentioned that it was pretty white-dominated."

✯✯✯

For many people in Dayton — children especially — the P.F. Chang's on Mad River and Miamisburg Centerville road was the closest they'd ever come to experiencing Chinese culture. Naturally, when they saw my Chinese name, YunZe, they would pause and raise one eyebrow, and my name would leave their mouth like the name of some rapper they’ve never heard of, "Young-Z?". When they saw my Chinese face, they'd squeeze their eyes together as if trying to make out a far-away road sign, and with their fingers they'd drag the corners of their eyes up, saying "Chinese", and down, "Japanese", and every once in a while a truly special gem of America would clasp his hands together and bow to me, "Ching-chong wing-wong." When I moved to Dayton, I discovered for the first time that I was Asian.

Of course, Dayton's history of racism didn't begin with me. The city was among the first to implement housing segregation policies as it rebuilt in the aftermath of the Daytonian flood in 1913. In the 1920s, an estimated 15 to 20 percent of Dayton's population were believed to be members of the Ku Klux Klan. From the 1940s to the 1970s, Dayton then adopted discriminatory mortgage and loan policies which resulted not only in segregation, but declining values for African American homes. Even in the 21st century, African Americans are still two times more likely as white people to be declined a mortgage when controlled for other variables.

✯✯✯

"The teachers loved me, but the kids were pretty racist, so I mostly stayed home and played video games."

My dual-monitor computer setup looms just over my laptop screen. I built it myself a couple years after I moved to have something to do, but I haven't played anything in months. My therapist takes a moment to take in what I said, probably filling in what I'd left unsaid.

"Yeah… That makes perfect sense to me. What about your life at home? How was your relationship with your mom?"

I look over at the door. It’s shut and locked. I wonder what my mom would think if she heard me talking about any of this.

"We weren't close — we still aren't. Most of the time she was at work, and even when she was home, nothing happened. We just… coexisted. I stopped telling her about anything from school because she just didn't get it.” I pause-, “That was also when I suspected I didn't only like girls, which I couldn't tell her because she was Christian and Chinese. I still don't talk to her much unless it's absolutely necessary."

"I can definitely understand that. Like- of course you're not going to be able to talk to your mom about a lot of things, especially when there's this taboo secret that you've got to keep hidden from her, right? And as far as I know, Chinese culture isn't particularly receptive to people in the LGBTQ community.”

✯✯✯

China has a surprising history of tolerance for homosexuality. In the Han and Qing dynasty, scribes kept a record of the emperor's male lovers. To the ancient Chinese, sexuality was irrelevant so long as one still met their familial obligations by having children. This aligns with Ancient Greece, where homosexual relationships were a celebrated source of pleasure. It wasn't until the rise of Christianity in western Europe that homosexuality was treated as an abominable sin. For China, homosexuality was banned under the rule of Mao Zedong, during the Cultural Revolution of the 20th century. It was then made legal in 1997 and removed from the list of mental illnesses, and gay culture flourished in metropolitan cities like Beijing and Shanghai. A Chinese court ruled a conversion-therapy clinic to pay reparations to a gay man after it had told him that they could "cure" his disease. It seemed that things were improving, but in the past decade, the government constricted the rights of LGBTQ people, along with other civil liberties, in Xi Jinping's move towards a more conservative China. It has been trying to boost childbirth and nationalism, and homosexuality is seen by some as an "imported" concept from the west, so therefore systematically oppressed.

I thought that my mother, who was both Christian and Chinese, couldn't possibly be accepting of my identity. I can only assume that the rest of family, who were still in China, held the same stigmatized views towards gays.  I reached for a fidget to distract myself whenever I found a guy attractive, and I'd scream to myself: I'm straight. I'M STRAIGHT. I'M NOT GAY! 

My screams were internal, of course, otherwise my mom, or my classmates, could hear me. And it's not as if Republican, suburban Ohio was ever the pride flagship. Plus, they'd already picked at the color of my skin, should I really give them something else to pick apart? 

✯✯✯

"I think there was definitely tension between being Chinese and being gay, yeah. I moved here, to Novi, for high school, which made it easier to be Chinese because everyone is Asian, but I didn't even come out to myself until I dated someone."

"Your high school had a lot of Asian people?"

"Yeah."

"What was your experience like there?"

✯✯✯ 

Novi, Michigan, 2018. I came into my room and set my backpack on the off-white carpet. Through the big, sliding window next to my desk, the soft afternoon glow drifted in with the autumn breeze. It was starting to get cold — my first fall in Michigan and my first year of high school. I pressed the power button on my computer and soon booted up my favorite game. 

My computer was modest by 2018 standards. It wasn't tragically bad, but also not something you should be proud of. It was fine, but not ideal — like Thanksgiving turkey, or HBO Max with ads. My mom strongly opposed gaming, saying it’s a waste of time and money when really I should be focused on academics and social relationships. Well, I was doing fine academically.

I thought about the upcoming Halloween party, and the girl who invited me to it, Mia. Mia was Asian. In fact, there were a lot of Asian kids at Novi high. Official data puts it at 43%, with the white population at 41%. I didn't know if I wanted to go. 

At my highschool, I'd walk down the halls, absent-mindedly browsing the posters and flyers on the wall while eavesdropping on other people's conversations. I made a game out of trying to guess if the people behind were Asian or white. The disappointing result was that for the most part, I couldn’t tell the difference unless a clearly ethnic name or activity was mentioned.

✯✯✯

"It was about the same. Everyone was Asian, but I think I was so used to not socializing and I never learned the skills for it. There was a Halloween party that I was invited to but I didn't go because I didn't feel like I was similar to anyone there, which was really weird because there would've been a lot of other Asian people there."

A long pause as she considers what to say, and then the words fall out of her mouth so carelessly, like they don't know the weight that they carry, "Are you familiar with the concept of the 1.5 generation?" 

✯✯✯

In immigrant speak, 1st generation Americans are those who are the first in their family to come to America, and 2nd generation Americans are those whose parents moved to America, and they were subsequently born here. The 1.5 generation describes those who immigrated to the new country before or during their early teens. Because they spend their formative years assimilating to a new country, they don't fit in with either side. They're the stuck in-betweens, the no-man’s land, between warring cultures.

Oftentimes, 1.5ers feel disconnected from both the culture of their birth and the culture of their immigrated country. They often adopt much quicker than their parents, and have trouble communicating their assimilated experiences. They’re like a bad puzzle piece that looks as though they could fit in many places, but in reality fits nowhere at all.

✯✯✯

Oh. That’s me. 

I turn to watch, through my window, the trees which just resumed their rustling, their leaves a soft gradient of colors that mean death. It’s incredible that every year, trees abandon their leaves just to please our eyes with pretty colors. I wonder though, if every fall, the winds come around this time to ruffle through the trees for a leaf — their leaf — but always end up blowing by.
