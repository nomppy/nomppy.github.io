one day, i woke up, and my backpack felt extra heavy.
i opened my bag to investigate the cause for the heaviness, but finding none decided to go forth with my day.
maybe it was meant to signal physical exhaustion or emotional baggage (can't we start calling that "griefcase"?), or something else more dire, like a burning desire to be done with all the things you never wanted to start in the first place.

a few minutes later, i hopped on a zoom meeting with my mentors on a research project, but as i stared at my macbook's LCD screen and it stared back, i felt suddenly and inexplicably overwhelmed.
overwhelmed with how much i have to do, and how truly _bored_ i felt.
despite every effort i made to manifest an early end to the meeting, it stretched on and on — stretched seconds into hours, stretched my will to live ice-thin.

i badly wanted to say something, make an excuse and leave, but i didn't want to be rude and didn't want to deal with the follow-ups.
so i stayed, and felt completely disassociated from this meeting and the entire project.
the more i listened, the more i grew to hate this project and found it pointless. 

i could barely keep my eyes open, and the second we finished, i took a half-hour nap/emotional breakdown on the table in the study lounge where i was just held prisoner.
disassociation is total disinterest + being trapped.

this blog is going to be a little unusual from what i typically write. 
i don't usually attempt to write detailed descriptions of events in my life, because 1) i'm bad at it, 2) because i tend to lose focus, and 3) i have a bad memory for events, which makes it hard to write about them.

has anyone else noticed that a lot of good blogs, if they're personal, also tend to be sad?
my bar for a good blog or story is if it makes me go "wow, that's so true. i've never thought about [random thing/life/great cosmic truth of the universe] that way before."

~~a lot of my favorites have also been centered around uncertainty and anxiety, so probably i just like seeing myself.~~
everyone gets sad, so maybe that's why sad blogs are good[^1].
heck, there's a reason famous writers are often deranged alcoholics. 

it's also kind of like [publication bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) in a way, in the sense that a happy-everything-is-great blog would be boring to read, just like how null effect results are almost never published.

that being said, i think writing something melancholic and sad and depressing and existential is much easier than writing something positive, uplifting, encouraging, or hopeful.
it is harder to write something positive for the same reason that it is easy to write something sad. 
and personally, i think those are better ones to read, and write. but that is not the case here

i woke up before the sun did and took the car out for a drive on empty roads, in the crescent moon-lit hours before dawn. 
the only sound i hear is of my tires splashing through tiny ponds accumulated through the midnight rain, and the light only of the glimmer as my headlights sweep over wet asphalt. 

how unusual it is, to be awake at this hour while everyone else sleeps. 
it comes with a solemn sense of responsibility, like that of a lamplighter, standing watch against the darkness.
i have always liked the winter and the night.

_i can't see shit._
this is what night does, i suppose.
but even though i can hardly make out what's 10 meters in front of me, my thoughts are clearer than ever.
in the day, you can see, but in the night you see clearly.

my eye passes over the pools of rain, seeing something different in each one.
in one i see that i used to be stupidly romantic. 
stupid. romantic. and stupidly romantic. 
high school junior me had no idea how to interact with people, yet he wanted a best friend.
his eyes shone brightly whenever he encountered a sweet, cottoncandy-like friendship in the literary world, but dimmed quickly as envy set in.
at a time when most social circles had stabilized, i was beginning to learn the most basic of social skills. 
it seems like an eternity since the tumultuous years of my high school, and i can hardly recognize myself in the reflection.
my cluelessness and romanticism, those i have kept, but gone was the anxious teenager who lived in a house but felt homeless.

in another pool of light, i saw myself learning to write — really write, not those MLA formatted essays — as a senior.
looking back, though, there's not much i wrote back then that i would still stand by proudly. 
in truth, there's not much of any part of what i did back then that i would wholly agree with.
my fashion sense was undeniably dodgy, and my music taste only marginally better. 
i usually assumed the moral/philosophical high ground in disagreements between me and my partner.
and i analyzed the hell out of _everything_.
this, again, all feels completely foreign to me now. 
they say that empathy is about understanding another's struggles, but i barely understand my own!

it was then that a wobbling car broke me out of my thoughts.
it, like me, was facing a bout of decision paralysis.
whereas i could not choose what classes i'd like to take, the driver of the car before me could not choose which lane they wanted to be in, and which blinker to keep on.
startled, i pulled away and ahead of the wobbly car, but then the puddles have lost their glimmer, leaving me in the dark.

according to psychology, our personal narratives are selective reconstructions of our memories to fit our current beliefs, and that our personality and the "story of our life" is constantly in flux. 

i spent a lot of time last year thinking about who i was, what i wanted, and in general a lot of moral and philosophical stuff, but i can hardly remember what i believed last month, much less what i believed a year ago.
maybe my memory is particularly bad or i'm particularly gullible to new ideas, but i feel like this is true for everyone even if to a lesser degree.

the other remaining possibility is that compared to last year, i really have changed a lot, but i don't remember it very well because it happened gradually and atomically. 
like if you start walking up a path with 1% grade, you're probably not going to notice until an hour later when you look back and suddenly realize that you're 150 ft (`50m`) above where you started. 

personal change is hard to measure because you _can't_ just look back[^2] and see make a visual comparison. 
even though i can feel that i'm a different person from when i started school, it's hard for me to figure out exactly what is different.
what's scary about it is that it's also hard to notice if you've actually been going down.

it's only my first week back from springbreak, but it feels like the 5th. 
i admittedly did not do much over the break, just read a book and binged netflix, so it is the fruits of my own (dis)labor that i'm reaping.

i've had tests and quizzes and projects and people and research projects and reading — i can't help but remember my fall semester, when i had mostly classes that didn't require much work, compared to now, where i'm consistently working ~15 hours a day[^3]. 

sometimes when you get hungry, you _get hungry_. 
i get hungry so fast that my fingers start trembling and i can do nothing but search for food — and i'll eat anything. 
hunger is a wildfire that consumes you unless you consume something else.
it's weird that doesn't really happen with thirst, isn't it? thirst doesn't come in exponentials. it is mild and timid.

this comes in an intellectual flavor, too. 
sometimes you hear about an interesting idea, and it's like you just saw an ad for [insert your preferred drink]. 
all of a sudden your mouth feels dry and you want a sip of what you just heard.

other times, though, other times i'm laying in bed and hunger envelopes me, and you can't resist hunger, so i just do what i must to fill the hole, whether that be in my stomach or in my mind.

it was probably one of those nights last semester that i felt extremely famished and ordered too much.
now there is too much on my plate and i'm staying up to finish it.

but it tastes so good. in hunger, even the lightest bit of seasoning tastes too good to be legal, like sin.
and when you have pringles? _uGH-_ 

the burst of discovery when they coincide with your tongue, the crunch of those devious hyperbolic paraboloids, the revelry and joy as you explore its surface, and the savory aftermath in your mouth, wonder and awe.

every time, after i experience art, i see more vividly than theories seem to suggest. 
it sweeps away the dust and breathes color back into my life, a life made monochromatic by classes and psets and code.
who knew that grueling computations literally sucked the soul out of you.

in the summer before college, i made the wise choice of enrolling in a creative writing class. 
the professor wasn't great- she would ramble for a long time without a clear point and teach nothing.

it was a great class, in theory, but for the whole semester i felt like i was thrashing in a pool of fog, and i just wanted to get to the other side and be done.
sometimes, i'd read something touching, and the fog would lift for a moment and i would see the dazzling shoreline, draped with lights, and the starry sky above.
but mostly, it was a foggy blur.

that first semester, i had also elected some other courses which i thought would be engaging but turned out to be not.
all but two of my classes felt like a waste of time, but i found out i enjoyed math, so when i picked my schedule for the current semester, i made sure it was packed with math and physics.

i badly wanted some structure in my life, something reliable to lean on.
but i'd overcompensated: in the fall, i read poems, wrote some too. i went out to performances with friends and let novelty guide me to any event. 
maybe my world was out of focus, maybe it was enveloped in smoke, but the smoke caught color from the shore and, with every breathe, filled me with it, too.
i didn't know where i was going or what i was doing, but it felt beautiful.
now, my world is sharper, sharpened by one definition after another.
block by block, i transformed the ground under my feet into an n x n grid, and i'm making measured progress.
the little shore with the colorful lights is gone, and so is the sky,
yet somehow still the fog remains, a cloud of black and white.

my situation isn't as miserable as it sounds- i'm having fun, truly, with math and physics. 
despite what most people may think, there is a lot of beauty, exploration, and creativity in math and physics.
it is not just analytical thinking and problem-solving.
at a higher level, it creates the same response that art does, but it is a more stoic, enlightening, transcendental kind of beauty, mostly[^4].
the burning out is real- enjoyment is there, too, but it does not come freely. one must work for it.

the sharpness and saturation of my life are like the position and velocities of heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
there is a tradeoff, between focus and color, and i can't have 100% of both. 
when there's lots to look at, i can't pick out anything in particular, and the harder i try to look, the less there is to see.
how stupid is this!

all my life, i've struggled to find a group where i would really fit in. 
some of it was... circumstantial, but i'd wager a majority chunk of the reason is because i'm picky.
some people are too much this and others too little that, and i could never find a "just right".

well duh, on two levels:
duh 1- no one i find is ever going to feel perfect.
duh 2- (imagine i'm gesturing to weigh these concepts):
romanticism...stoicism, math...art, focus...color, writing a blog...sleeping before 2am. 
i hardly know what i'm looking for, so how would i ever find it?

it can be hard, even, to know where you are at. 
i did not realize how much i'd changed until i wrote [#6](#6).
without a reference point, it's very easy to lose track of where you are.

we as humans have many wants, probably a literal infinite amount of them. 
i want to write and i want to sleep and i want to read poems and math books and be good a what i do and enjoy life and be emotional but not sentimental.
i want to hang out with friends and be active in my communities instead of being that person who is always "too busy".
i want all of these things and more, but there is only so much time.

what do you do if you want to maximize the area of a rectangle?

trick question! 
you turn it into a circle...
just kidding, i can't draw circles.

but really, to maximize a product you balance each of the factors. 
one thing that never hurts is having clear priorities.
prioritize balance.




[^1]: if you or a loved one wants to start writing, all you have to do is to get sad and then think deeply about your experience to see if there's anything valuable or interest you can extract from it. it's not like sadness is in short supply.
[^2]: some people seem to have a much better idea of where they're at relative to their past. if you're one of these supernatural people, i envy you and please tell me how you do it.
[^3]: for all of high school, i slept around 8-9 hours a day, but i'm gradually trying to reduce my sleep hours to squeeze more time out for work. frankly, if i hadn't slept less this week, i wouldn't have gotten everything done.
[^4]: there is this really great book called "Mathematics for Human Flourshing", by Francis Su,  which talks about all the ways that math satisfies human needs. one of the chapters is beauty, and in it the author describes four different types of beauty. the sensory, wondrous, insightful, and transcent beauties. you should read it, even you think you don't like math.
