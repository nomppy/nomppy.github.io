my backpack felt extra heavy this morning. 
that's supposed to be a metaphor for something, but i don't think i have the mental capacity to figure out a clever poetic meaning for it right now.

i zipped open my bag to investigate the cause for the heaviness, but finding none decided to go forth with my day.
maybe it was meant to signal physical exhaustion, or emotional baggage (can we start calling that "griefcase"?), or something else like a burning desire to be done with all the things you never wanted to start in the first place.

in a zoom meeting i had with some research mentors today, i was suddenly and inexplicably overwhelmed with boredom and just complete... disinterest.
here were two very nice people whom i genuinely respect and like, and they were trying to help me with my research project (not in physics), but as hard as i tried i found myself gradually losing my grip on their words.

i badly wanted to say something, make an excuse and leave, but etiquette prevented me from doing so. it would've been rude and i also didn't want to deal with the follow-ups.
so i stayed, and felt completely disassociated from this meeting and the entire project.
the more i listened, the more i grew to hate this project and found it pointless. 

i was so relieved when our meeting ended that i immediately took a half-hour nap on the table in the study lounge where i was at.
then, finding it uncomfortable, went home for another nap.
i think this is peak bio/neurosci.
i also think disassociation is total disinterest + being trapped.

anyway, what does a shitty morning have to do with blogging? 
to be clear, i have no certain idea. 
what follows is pure speculation on my end.

"good" blogs tend to be sad for whatever reason.
at least, in my rating of blogs, the good ones usually involve some sort of sad event in life, from which the blogger was able to extract some interesting insight and whatnot.

to me, a good blog takes something from your life that is relatable to others, and offers a new or otherwise interesting perspective to the reader.
when i read a good blog, i go "wow, that's so true. i've never thought about my life that way before."

maybe it doesn't have to be intrinsically sad, but some of the best i've read have centered around self-development, confronting existential questions, uncertainty, depression, anxiety, etc. etc. 

blogs can, of course, be positive as well.
in my experience, the good ones usually center around practicality, talk about how nice something is and appreciates it, or are overall-positive reflections containing some hard-earned wisdom. 
but there are fewer of those in general, and they usually have a stoic tone at best, rather than a happy one.

the reason for this disparity, i think, is simple. 
it's probably just what sadness was designed to do, after all â€” tells us that something isn't going quite right and signals us to take corrective action. 
hence, when you're sad, you become reflective, and those who write start writing.

it's also kind of like [publication bias]() in the sense that a happy-everything-is-great blog would be boring to read, just like how null effect results are almost never published.
this is almost too obvious, like: everyone has stacks of depression-fuled poetry that have either been burned or will never see the light of day.

i think the easiest way to start, for anyone interested in writing, is to get sad and then think deeply about your experience to see if there's anything valuable or interest you can extract from it.
it's not like sadness is in short supply.

one can start with journaling, but not the kind that goes like "today i went to class, failed a quiz, then hung out with some friends". 
you don't want a diary, diaries are void of emotional vulnerability. 
you're supposed to meditate on your life and process your emotions from a place of clarity, and then put it on paper with the best words you've got.

once you can journal, blogging and other share-able forms of writing aren't far away. 
there's not much i can say that hasn't already been said better, so i'll just link a few resources for those interested.

that being said, i think writing something melancholic and sad and depressing and existential is much easier than writing something positive, uplifting, encouraging, or hopeful.
it is harder to write something positive for the same reason that it is easy to write something sad. 
in my opinion, those types of writings are better, partially because i feel better having read it, and partially because i intrinsically appreciate more difficult things.

that shouldn't discourage you from writing anything sad. 
in fact, when you first start writing, your writing is almost certainly going to be sad, both in the tone and in the quality. 
that's okay and the only effective anecdote i've found is to remember that you are your own primary audience. 

you write for yourself first-and-foremost, and secondly you might share those writings with other people. 
but when it comes to that i don't think it's helpful to worry too much about the audience. 
your audience is whoever is coming back to read your stuff regularly, so just send it to a bunch of people and whoever stays, stays.
