If I had to use one word to describe ANSI Common LISP, it would have to be **[:sexy.](#sexy)**
Lisp is sexy, not sexy like hot actors are sexy, but like a train through Switzerland is sexy.

Don't worry about the parentheses, there's an explanation for that:

Why is Lisp so great?  
...  
...  
... You wouldn't get it. 

Actually I don't really either. 
You see, I am only but a humble Lisp Padawan. 
I've not yet learned all the ways of Lisp, like macros and such.
Though as it is written: [:there is no bad Lisp code, only bad Lisp coders](#citation-needed).

Frankly, I don't actually want to write about Lisp. 
Because as much as I like it as a language, the truth is that I haven't used it to any significant extent, so I can't speak on it fully.

Same with the train through Switzerland. 
I've seen pictures and videos of trains, but rarely had the opportunity to be on one 
— and I've seen Switzerland also, in movies and instagram reels, but I've never been there myself.

I have a vivid imagination, so often I find myself liking the _idea_ of doing something: a research project, playing an instrument, reading a book, romantic relationships, etc... but then as I learn more and more about the topic, the decidedly less sexy parts of it begin to rear its head and make me cringe.

Our brains are so good at displaying imagery, and some people are really good at producing it, whether that be through words, animation, music, pictures, or something else. 
That is why I think one of the worst things the internet has done to us is given us too many ideas for how to live. 
_What a [:first world](#first-world) problem-_, I know, _-some people don't get a choice._ 
Yes, yes, but I'm serious when I say that an excess of availability and accessibility to choices is not good for you. 

From the very start one is unsatisfied due to [:choice overload](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias), then you have all these marketing people putting sexy little ideas in your head about quitting your job to go freelance, or going off to southern France, or deciding to become a cybersecurity expert, or the catch-all "doing AI" 
<small class='whisper'>(which also sounds a little unethical) </small>.
They never tell you the boring parts:
the mundane cost of doing science, like spending hours tweaking mirrors to align a laser beam.
The mound of research writers do before and during a piece.

So how can you tell if you really like something, or just the idea of it?

_Just try it,_ people less cynical than me about the world would say. 
I'm a big advocate for risk-taking, especially the kind that enables you to learn more about what you like and what you don't like. 
But you can't try everything.
These risks come attached with opportunity costs, and college, the place where you're supposed to be trying out things, doesn't last long enough for someone to meaningfully explore all their choices without getting too far behind.
Some majors, like math or physics, have to be pretty much taken up from the beginning. 

There is an idea, a romantic one, that every little thing in the world has a secret — that if only you looked hard enough, patiently enough — you'd discover its delightful inner workings, and attain enlightenment.

I think to really like something is to discover the secret hidden in its mundaneity.

Because if you do that, if this thing, [:whatever it is](#whatever), can effortlessly make you happy, then your baseline level of happiness increases, which leads to a happier life.

Sometimes I feel as if my life is a constant, repeating pattern of brief periods of self-discovery and intense self-improvement, followed by long, depressing valleys where I diddle around doing nothing.
Drinking beer, or other types of bad alcohol. 
Juice is too sweet, water is too bland, and no amount of carbonation in soda can smudge the alarming feeling of drinking liquid sugar. 
If my mind were occupied with any higher-order functions whatsoever, water would taste fine. 
But boredom and boring beverages will make me an alcoholic yet.

In some sense, some things consistently bring you joy, so they become the things you really like — and that's all there is to it. 
If you really like something, you'll already really like it. 
And if you don't, then you probably just like some property associated with it, like money, or lifestyle, or validation, clout, etc. 

-which is fine- I mean, I used to judge people for burdening themselves with things they had no genuine interest in ([:alright, I still do](#still-do)), 
but I get where they're coming from.
It really is harder to be happy if you don't have money. 
But to like a thing purely for the thing itself, even the not-so-sexy parts, is to me one of the greatest pleasures in life.

I don't think you can really grow to like something.
See it in a different light and thus value it, sure, but then you're liking it for a different reason.
For instance, A CS student who hates coding is probably not going to enjoy it years down the line, but they might like the organizational aspect of project management. 
In the same vein, if I ever started liking finance and economics, it would not be because I want to be as rich as possible, but because it's a big, complicated game, and I like playing games. 




# :x sexy

The distinction between hot and sexy are often blurred, so I’ll clear it up. Hot is when you write a complex program to do something and it works, _sexy_ is when this program only does exactly what it needs to, with elegance, grace, and all the things that makes code not just readable, but a piece of literature.

# :x citation needed

_Citation needed._

Though seriously, Lisp is great. 
Above is a program I wrote for philosophy class, that parses and validates symbolic proofs.

# :x first world

is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that "first world" and "third world" countries sounds an awful lot like the first, second, and third estates of the French revolution?

# :x whatever

a subject, a job, a person. a place, even.

# :x still do

Alright, I still do, but it's not because I think they're fake or dishonest, but because I think they would be more effective if they did what they liked,
just because of increased enthusiasm.
