## there is something i do that probably not many people do.

i encode my lovers in morse,
as text vibrations on my phone
by the first letter of their name. 
like dot-dash, for A, the first. so 
bz-bzzz became a two-note melody. 
a symphony i’d recognize instantly, 
fortissimo — there’s no lowercase 
in morse.

eventually, your buzzing grew quiet, and
i had to avoid the chugging traintracks, 
and rooms with clamoring blackboards;
everything that murmured your letter—
and there is no lowercase in morse—
i turned down iambic meters, even
my own heart’s murmurs, that roaring 
beating of a fool who’d already forgotten 
its own murder, i stilled. and i still 
kept to my plans, went to new york,
but when i got past TSA, 
all i could hear,
was the da-Da—da-Da—da-Da—da-
Da—da-Da—da-Da. da-Da. da-Da. 
of my own little
four-wheeled suitcase,
clicking mercilessly. 

thankfully, there are many people with the letter A.

i write my friends’ in morse, to 
hear their name pronounced in chalk,
or busy streets, washing machines.

the most important thing of all,
amidst an ocean of buzzing calls,
is to know who it’s from.

i’m very much so out-of-sight, out of mind, and i dont think much of my friends. 
but i want to, i do. because 

there’s nothing you can do to wind back the time spent not thinking of someone. it’s a lesson i keep learning and forgetting, and forget to learn, though sometimes,

i wish i would forget.
if only morse could cross time.
so, so far away.
