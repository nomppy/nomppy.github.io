Social media has been blamed to death for our generations' problems, but I'd like to add just one more. 

Some time in the past few years it became fashionable to have mental health awareness.
Day in, day out, the same Positive Psychology Paradigm: higher self-worth, greater self-love, more self-acceptance, less self-hate, more self-respect, clearer self-perception, better self-awareness.

# Internet advice
Popular media constantly tell us that the key to maintaining good mental health is

Mental health advice on the internet 
we know so much about what everyone else thinks.
we’re rhe most self conscious generafion, but ironicallly, the least self aware.
the more i interact with people, the less im confident about myself, ans
worrying about what other people think takes away energy to think about ourselves

is question of “who am i?” is overshadows by “how do i want others to think of me?” 
the question of “what do i want to do?” is supplemented by “how would it look if i did this?”
i think our generation and the proceeding generations are increasingly more concerned with our projected image than our self-perception.

Some time in the past few years it became fashionable to use dark mode. 

What we are is _self-indulgent._
If you follow the founding idea of capitalism to its moral and philosophical conclusion, you end up with overly self-focused values and metrics for what is a life well-lived.

This is the origin of jealousy and pride: achievement, wealth, fame, power, individual excellence. 
An important discovery benefits us all, but too often we attribute such an achievement to a single entity, and we get jealous as a result of comparison. 


We try to work out our mental health like we work our bodies in the gym, and the feedback we get is not physicla exhaustion, but mental exhaustion. 
But it's so easy to mistake mental exhaustion as lack of mental health.

I'm all burnt out with "self-improvement". 
What we are improving are not virtues, but rather skills like time-management and productivity, or techniques for controlling our lives.


in the modern paradigm of positive psychology. the focus is for the individual to use the self, not others, as the metric of growth and improvement. when we face interpersonal issues, we should remember our self-worth. we should acknowledge and express our emotions. we should have personal values, beliefs, self-awareness. we are encouraged to work on these things constantly. 

and we judge each other constantly!— not just on ability but on character. our desire for unending improvement has spilled over to the personal level. colleges and employers look them, stories and news praise them, this our meritocracy expands beyond a competition of skill, but a competition of personal character. a competition where perfection is unattainable, and comparison is certain.

it may also be worth it to keep in mind that while western societies worship the self, there exists other value systems that are not self centered.  


- judging other people on how well-lived their lives are is how you come to judge yourself
- chinese health show that was actually terrible for your physical health.. parallel to mental health, self-actualization, etc. 
- life is a series of twists and turns and then you die
- want to do everything, be everything at once. comparing yourself to other people 
- comparing your abilities is not so different from comparing your qualities of life
- we're a lot more dramatic then before. seen in music (include rach's performances)

**joining the dark side**  
_it's brimming with light_

- " " " " " " " " " " " " dark mode  " " " "
- relentless self improvement is bad (see essay to aimee for details)
- full of misleading, selfish advice on social media fueling misunderstanding and competition
- very similar to meritocracy and competing to be the best at something
- like dark mode, we probably dont even realize that the trend is taking over our lives. the people on the other side seem crazy.
