# Bracelet making
<!-- Every holiday season, I feel a little guilty that my mom buys me things that I want, but I rarely ever give anything back in return. -->
<!-- Yesterday, I decided that this year would be different. I scoped around all the usual places for potential gifts, texted friends for ideas, and eventually came across a blog post of homemade gift ideas.  -->

<!-- They had some pics and guides for cute bracelets, and I thought, "Oh yea, I can make bracelets!... I can make my mom and stepdad matching bracelets!"  -->
Sometimes an idea hits you so hard and becomes so obvious that you wonder why it took you so long to stumble on it, but when you _do_ stumble on it, you get the satisfying feeling of watching everything click into place. In retrospect, this idea felt so natural because it was everything I wanted in a gift — inexpensive, original, and fun to make. I went out to the nearest craft store to get materials (it was a Michael's. I had to look it up because I've never been to one before). The guides I saw looked pretty simple: get some cords, get some beads, string the beads onto the cords and tie it up — done! 

The guides didn't tell me that there were so many different options for every conceivable part, nor did they mention the various types of "findings" I'd need to connect cording to endcaps and endcaps to closures. 
This is all to say that the 2 hours I spent in the jewelry isle googling everything about handmade bracelets were completely justified. 

In retrospect, I made it much, much more harder than it should've been. 
Every design I saw either used too many different components (which means more money, since I would need to buy a whole pack of a particular fasting even if I needed only one), wouldn't last very long, or didn't look good. 
Being broke forces you to be creative. I ended up Frankensteining together my own design based on ideas gleamed from various guides and examples.
I walked out of the store cradling my careful assortment of cordings, glue, charms, and other fastings, excited like a designer before presenting his pitch to the engineer — everything would come together perfectly! Surely...

Fast-forward 3 hours, to 1 in the morning, I'm still sitting on the carpet, fumbling with two ends of bruised, scratched, leather cords, trying to tie a knot that could hold all my charms in place. 
My laptop sits on the floor in front of me, its screen streaming the penultimate episode of season two of "Alice in Borderland", which just came out that day. 
This might, partially, be why I've been trying to make this bracelet for the past 3 hours, but I submit that it's only a _small_ part, for the repeated back-and-forth due to general cluelessness contributed much more. 

For example, when I finally found a knot that was both effective and aesthetically pleasing, but due to a fault in my design I needed to tie the same knot, in reverse, on the other end. 
How the heck do you tie a knot in reverse?

Moreover, what does it even mean to tie a knot in reverse?

It's entirely possible (and probably likely) that I am not using the proper name, but what I mean by tying a knot in reverse is this: imagine you have two seperate strings (or a pair of wired earbuds, the most natural medium for knotting) which are both anchored on one end, you thread them through a ring and perform a series of loops, crosses, etc. which becomes a knot on the ring. 
Now suppose you flip the direction the strings were anchored relative to the ring. If they were below the ring, they are now above, if they were coming from the left, they now come from the right. 
How do you tie the same knot from this new direction?

If you repeated the same moves as the other direction, you would end up with a mirror image of the knot, not the original (try it to convince yourself! you could use, say, a keyring and a pair of wired earbuds). 
What you actually have to do, since the direction is now flipped, is to flip the original knot around, and trace the path of the strings, starting from the end of the knot to the beginning, and then replicate that path.
Usually, the moves needed to make the same knot from one direction is entirely different from the opposite direction. 
In my case, I arrived at the original knot with 4 simple, alternating, symmetric moves, the kinds of instructions you'd see in a "How to tie a tie", but in the reverse direction I could hardly understand what path I was taking, much less distill them into simple moves.

So I learned how to tie a knot in reverse, but as I said before, this was all due to a fault in my design. 
I later made a small improvement to make it look better, which incidentally removed any need for reverse-knotting altogether.

# Skills accumulating

> Reverse knotting? What's the use of that? It's not applicable to me.

Maybe none at all, or maybe it'll manifest in some insight towards knot theory sometime in the future, but more likely its effect, if any, will be many times removed from what I know now that I can't possibly make an accurate prediction.
When I was in middle school, I wanted to make Minecraft videos on YouTube, and I thus learned to use Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. Video and image editing has since presented themselves as useful tools in projects ranging from classwork to personal montages.

As a rarer example, I learned a good chunk of computer networking through building a second router for my home network, as well as miscellanous UNIX things and virtualization. Later, I was able to use what I learned of computer networking to (cleverly) rickroll dozens of my friends at a campsite.
These cases go on and on. I learned to write code by writing a discord bot. I learned to write websites by making my own. On occassion, I'm put up to a task and, to my pleasure, I realize that the project fits my skillset perfectly. 

Just like how making a bracelet felt natural for subconcious reasons that only surfaced later, after some analyzing, so too is the usefulness of certain skills hidden from the present. 
It may not be obvious how learning something will help you in the future, and that is the reason often cited for refusing to learn — it's not applicable — but at least from my experience, "random" knowledge and skills have a way of popping back in your life in unexpected, but pleasant ways. 

The point of making things, then, is that it's the best way to learn something. As any engineer will tell you, when you try to make something is when you find out if your idea really was sound.
Making something, whether physical or digital, is the emperical validation to your theories. Why don't we understand stars that well? Because we can't hang a black hole on a pendulum and watch it swing. It's so difficult to verify anything not on our scale, so take advantage of the things you can emperically verify.

# Making (and giving)
Giving gifts is hard. The people you want/feel obligated to give gifts to don't make clear what they want. Every Christmas, millions^[citation needed] of people rediscover the knotting guilt of not knowing what their bestfriend/family/significant other likes. But you can escape this fate by — surprise! — making something yourself.

You look online for gift guides, browes the homepage of Amazon, walk into a gift shop, yet everything is prohibitively expensive and nothing seems to fit into that narrow intersection of things that are nice, fits the gift recipient, and inexpensive.
Eventually you give up, and this is how people end up with way too many Amazon Echo's or some other flashy-but-ultimately-useless-tech's.
I'm not saying that these are _bad_ gifts. Some of the most common gifts you can pick up at a gift shop are nice and have a lot of thought behind them (it's the thought that counts, really), but there's nothing quite as unique, cheap, thoughtful, and as fun as gifting something you made yourself. 

"Gifts" isn't the most popular [love language](https://5lovelanguages.com), but it's certainly the most ridiculed. Someone whose primary love language is gifts is assumed to be materialistic, or a downright asshat. 
But I think the love languages are just as much about how you _express_ love as how you prefer to experience it. 
If your love language is "acts of service", you probably also serve others as an act of love. Likewise for gifting. 
In this frame, I think gifting would rank a lot higher among the love languages. 
Perhaps the real reason "gifts" gets a bad rap is because it's associated with someone who only likes receiving gifts, not giving. But none of the other love languages look too great either if someone only liked being the receiver and not the giver. 

I digress. This is all to say that a thoughtful gift, delivered with a heartfelt card (words of affirmation), can be really meaningful to both giver and receiver. [Life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html), do things that bring you joy.

# How to be creative
Let me preface this section by saying that I am by no means the most credible source for creating cool and interesting things. If every human was sorted by the quality of their creative output, I'd expect myself to fall roughly in the 50th percentile, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

"Creativity" belongs in a group of elusive qualities, along with "leadership", "intuition", etc..., qualities that everyone agrees are good but are hard to define. The first step, is to stop trying to be creative. This is slightly confusing, but I believe the first step to achieving anything is to [have the right motivations](http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html).
Your aim shouldn't be anything other than pure. It's okay to make things for fun instead of for your resume, the latter part will come naturally.

## Doing > Planning

> Planning is indispensible. Plans are shit.

Plan out what you want to make, the parts involved, how everything will fit/work together, but know that your project will likely die unless your plan evolves.
Even if you have no idea what you're doing, try it anyway, things usually appear more complicated than they actually are.
When I was building my router, I knew literally nothing about computer networking. I did a lot of googling and learned what parts I needed, researched different approarches. _Planning is indispensible._ Threw them together into a working machine and followed the tutorial until nothing worked anymore and I spent 2 weeks fixing it. _Plans are shit._

## Know how to get help
Google is _essential._ Even if you don't use it regularly (like me, who defaults to Duckduckgo), Google still tends to return much more relevant results when trying to fix a problem. 
If you're writing code, pasting the error message will usually get you pretty far. Then there's always Stackoverflow.
Don't be afraid to post on public forums like Stack Exchange or Reddit. Do your research first, ask the question clearly, and you won't get negative responses. 

Here are some sources to help you ask good questions:
[How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info), [No Hello](https://nohello.net/en/), [How to ask smart questions](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

## Don't write what you know
"Write what you know" is advice commonly directed at aspiring writers who don't know what to write about. 
This is boring. Don't do this. 

In writing as in general creativity, you should aim to create what you yourself want to see. Write the blog you want to read, not one that merely regurgitates what you already know.
"Write what you know" is unhelpful on two counts. One, it's easy for you to get bored recording what you already know (it's like writing documentation for code, a task nobody envies). Two, any requirements you impose on your ideas blocks a big chunk of the **idea space**. 

Some restrictions are necessary and beneficial to creativity. It's why people write books without certain letters. But this is not one of them.

## Restrictions force creativity
If computers were fast enough to do extremely large matrix multiplications, I'm talking billions by billions matrices, as is common in nuclear and subatomic physics research, we'd do just that. But we can't even store that much data, let along compute it. So, people have to get clever, optimizing the computation in numerous ways to make it feasible. 

You don't have to solve physics problems, of course, but the underlying principle remains. The surest way of guaranteeing a creative solution is to have a problem so difficult that you couldn't do it any regular way, with many restricting factors forcing you to make something new. 

## Follow your vision
Having a good idea is hard. In fact, it might be the hardest part of the whole process. 
So when you have a good idea, you should stick to it. Do whatever it takes, learn whatever you need to, to make your vision come true. 
You learn so much along the way, and though an unyielding stubborness to your idea will bring many difficulties, they are precisely what will force you to be creative.
