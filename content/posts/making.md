# Bracelet making
Every holiday season, I feel a little guilty that my mom buys me things that I want, but I rarely ever give anything back in return.
Yesterday, I decided that this year would be different. I scoped around all the usual places for potential gifts, texted friends for ideas, and eventually came across a blog post of homemade gift ideas. 

They had some pics and guides for cute bracelets, and I thought, "Oh yea, I can make bracelets!... I can make my mom and stepdad matching bracelets!" Sometimes an idea hits you so hard and becomes so obvious that you wonder why it took you so long to stumble on it, but when you _do_ stumble on it, you get the satisfying feeling of watching everything click into place. In retrospect, this idea felt so natural because it was everything I wanted in a gift -- inexpensive, original, and fun to make. I went out to the nearest craft store to get materials (it was a Michael's. I had to look it up because I've never been to one before). The guides I saw looked pretty simple: get some cords, get some beads, string the beads onto the cords and tie it up -- done! 

The guides didn't tell me that there were so many different options for every conceivable part, nor did they mention the various types of "findings" I'd need to connect cording to endcaps and endcaps to closures. 
This is all to say that the 2 hours I spent in the jewelry isle googling everythingn about handmade bracelets were completely justified. 
Eventually, with the help of some kind strangers, I got what I needed and headed home to make the bracelets. 

In retrospect, I made it much, much more harder than it should've been. 
Every design I saw either used too many different components (which means more money, since I would need to buy a whole pack of a particular fasting even if I needed only one), wouldn't last very long, or didn't look good. 
Being broke forces you to be creative. I ended up Frankensteining together my own design based on ideas gleamed from various guides and examples.
I walked out of the store cradling my careful assortment of cordings, glue, charms, and other fastings, excited like a designer before presenting his pitch to the engineer -- everything would come together perfectly! Surely...

Fast-forward 3 hours, to 1 in the morning, I'm still sitting on the carpet, fumbling with two ends of bruised, scratched, leather cords, trying to tie a knot that could hold all my charms in place. 
My laptop sits on the floor in front of me, its screen streaming the penultimate episode of season two of "Alice in Borderland", which just came out that day. 
This might, partially, be why I've been trying to make this bracelet for the past 3 hours, but I submit that it's only a _small_ part, for the repeated back-and-forth due to general cluelessness contributed much more. 

For example, when I finally found a knot that was both effective and aesthetically pleasing, but due to a fault in my design I needed to tie the same knot, in reverse, on the other end. 
How the heck do you tie a knot in reverse?

Moreover, what does it even mean to tie a knot in reverse?

It's entirely possible (and probably likely) that I am not using the proper name, but what I mean by tying a knot in reverse is this: imagine you have two seperate strings (or a pair of wired earbuds, the most natural medium for knotting) which are both anchored on one end, you thread them through a ring and perform a series of loops, crosses, etc. which becomes a knot on the ring. 
Now suppose you flip the direction the strings were anchored relative to the ring. If they were below the ring, they are now above, if they were coming from the left, they now come from the right. 
How do you tie the same knot from this new direction?

If you repeated the same moves as the other direction, you would end up with a mirror image of the knot, not the original (try it to convince yourself! you could use, say, a keyring and a pair of wired earbuds). 
What you actually have to do, since the direction is now flipped, is to flip the original knot around, and trace the path of the strings, starting from the end of the knot to the beginning, and then replicate that path.
Usually, the moves needed to make the same knot from one direction is entirely different from the opposite direction. 
In my case, I arrived at the original knot with 4 simple, alternating, symmetric moves, the kinds of instructions you'd see in a "How to tie a tie", but in the reverse direction I could hardly understand what path I was taking, much less distill them into simple moves.

So I learned how to tie a knot in reverse, but as I said before, this was all due to a fault in my design. 
I later made a small improvement to make it look better, which incidentally removed any need for reverse-knotting altogether.

# Skills accumulating
_On the value of learning through making._
> Reverse knotting? What's the use of that? It's not applicable to me.

Maybe none at all, or maybe it'll manifest in some insight towards knot theory sometime in the future, but more likely its effect, if any, will be many times removed from what I know now that I can't possibly make an accurate prediction.
When I was in middle school, I wanted to make Minecraft videos on YouTube, and I thus learned to use Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. Video and image editing has since presented themselves as useful tools in projects ranging from classwork to personal montages.
As a rarer example, I learned a good chunk of computer networking through building a second router for my home network, as well as miscellanous UNIX things and virtualization. Later, I was able to use what I learned of computer networking to (cleverly) rickroll dozens of my friends at a campsite.
These cases go on and on. I learned to write code by writing a discord bot. I learned to write websites by making my own. On occassion, I'm put up to a task and, to my pleasure, I realize that the project fits my skillset perfectly. 
Just like how making a bracelet felt natural for subconcious reasons that only surfaced later, after some analyzing, so too is the usefulness of certain skills hidden from the present. 
It may not be obvious how learning something will help you in the future, and that is the reason often cited for refusing to learn -- it's not applicable -- but at least from my experience, "random" knowledge and skills have a way of popping back in your life in unexpected, but pleasant ways. 

The point of making things, then, is that it's the best way to learn something. As any engineer will tell you, when you try to make something is when you find out if your idea really was sound.
Making something, whether physical or digital, is the emperical validation to your theories. Why don't we understand stars that well? Because we can't hang a black hole on a pendulum and watch it swing. It's so difficult to verify anything not on our scale, so take advantage of the things you can emperically verify.
