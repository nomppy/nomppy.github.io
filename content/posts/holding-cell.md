### Half Past Midnight In My Holding Cell

*Do it.*  
My hands tremble.  
The razor clatters to the ground.  
He begs for mercy.  

My hands are trembling.  
*Don't hesitate. Make it quick.*  
He's begging for mercy.  
*Please, don't kill me.*  

I hesitate â€” *should I?*  
I nudge the door to a gentle stop.  
*Please don't kill me. I have a family.*  
I feel the cold blade between my fingers.  

The door shuts. A slab of wood  
between me and the living world.  
I feel the razor's graze, its icy gleam  
whispering the melody of a lonely moon.  

He's called out to the living world.  
He's done everything he could.  
I hum the lullaby of a dying moon  
to quiet his fear, to silence his doubt.  

I'm doing everything I could  
to make it painless for myself.  
I quiet my fears. I silence my doubts.  
I forget all those who I've ever cared about.  

To make it easy and painless for myself,   
I pretend I'm executing someone else.      
Not anyone I've ever cared about,          
just a stranger and nobody else.           

I pretend to execute someone else.  
*Do it.*  
Just a stranger and nobody else.  
My razor clatters to the ground.
