### Half Past Midnight In My Holding Cell

*Do it.*  
My hands tremble.  
The razor clatters to the ground.  
He begs for mercy.  

My hands are trembling.  
*Don't hesitate. Make it quick.*  
He's begging for mercy.  
*Please, don't kill me.*  

I hesitate â€” *make it quick!*  
I close the door.  
*Please don't kill me. I have a family.*  
I feel the cold blade between my fingers.  

I shut the bathroom door  
over his calls for help.  
I feel the razor's graze, its icy gleam cuts  
how a lullaby cuts through nightmares.  

He's tried calling out for help.  
He's done everything he could.  
I sing him a lullaby  
to quiet his fears.  

I'm doing everything I can  
to make it painless for myself.  
I quiet my fears. I silence my doubts.  
I forget all those I've ever cared about.  

To make it easy and painless for myself,  
I pretend I'm executing someone else.  
Not anyone I've ever cared about,  
just a stranger and nobody else.  

I pretend to execute someone else.  
*Do it.*  
Just a stranger and nobody else.  
My razor clatters to the ground.
