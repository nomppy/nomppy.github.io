### There is no dignified way to cry in a college dorm

Tears want to fall, but if they fell   
they'd fall onto the couch which       
you share with your roommate.          
And you're not that close.             
                                      
At home you have more options:         
on your bed, on the toilet,            
on the floor of the kitchen            
(if you're really going through it).   
                                      
But when you live in a college dorm    
if you need to cry, you'd just       
have to pick between crying            
inside, or crying outside.             
                                      
I once saw a man hunched over,         
scantly 2 feet off of a forest trail,  
sobbing into his cupped hands, face hidden.  
What I'd give to trade spots with him.
