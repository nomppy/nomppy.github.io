one day, i woke up, and my backpack felt extra heavy.
i opened my bag to investigate the cause for the heaviness, but finding none decided to go forth with my day.
maybe it was meant to signal physical exhaustion or emotional baggage (can't we start calling that "griefcase"?), or something else more dire, like a burning desire to be done with all the things you never wanted to start in the first place.

a few minutes later, i hopped on a zoom meeting with my mentors on a research project, but as i stared at my macbook's LCD screen and it stared back, i felt suddenly and inexplicably overwhelmed.
overwhelmed with how much i have to do, and how truly _bored_ i felt.
despite every effort i made to manifest an early end to the meeting, it stretched on and on — stretched seconds into hours, stretched my will to live ice-thin.

i badly wanted to say something, make an excuse and leave, but i didn't want to be rude and didn't want to deal with the follow-ups.
so i stayed, and felt completely disassociated from this meeting and the entire project.
the more i listened, the more i grew to hate this project and found it pointless.

this blog is going to be a little unusual from what i typically write. 
i don't usually attempt to write detailed descriptions of events in my life, because 1) i'm bad at it, 2) because i tend to lose focus, and 3) i have a bad memory for events, which makes it hard to write about them.
sorry in advance that this post will run a bit long.

has anyone else noticed that a lot of good blogs, if they're personal, also tend to be sad?
my bar for a good blog or story is if it makes me go "wow, that's so true. i've never thought about [random thing/life/great cosmic truth of the universe] that way before."

~~a lot of my favorites have also been centered around uncertainty and anxiety, so probably i just like seeing myself.~~
everyone gets sad, so maybe that's why sad blogs are good[^1].
heck, there's a reason famous writers are often deranged alcoholics. 

that being said, i think writing something melancholic and sad and depressing and existential is much easier than writing something positive, uplifting, encouraging, or hopeful.
it is harder to write something positive for the same reason that it is easy to write something sad. 
and personally, i think those are better ones to read, and write. but that won't the case here.

i woke up before the sun did and took the car out for a drive on empty roads, in the crescent moon-lit hours before dawn. 
the only sound i hear is of my tires splashing through tiny ponds accumulated through the midnight rain, and the light only of the glimmer as my headlights sweep over wet asphalt. 

how unusual it is, to be awake at this hour while everyone else sleeps. 
it comes with a solemn sense of responsibility, like that of a lamplighter, standing watch against the darkness.
i have always liked the winter and the night.

my eye passes over the pools of rain, seeing something different in each one.
in one i see that i used to be stupidly romantic. 
it seems like an eternity since the tumultuous years of my high school, and i can hardly recognize myself in the reflection.
my cluelessness and romanticism, those i have kept, but gone was the anxious teenager.

in another pool of light, i saw myself learning to write as a senior.
looking back, though, there's not much i wrote back then that i would still stand by proudly. 
in truth, there's not much of any part of what i did back then that i would wholly agree with.
my fashion sense was undeniably dodgy, and my music taste only marginally better. 
and i had an annoying tendency to overanalyze interpersonal situations.
this, again, all felt completely foreign to me.

it was then that a wobbling car broke me out of my thoughts.
it, like me, was facing a bout of decision paralysis.
whereas i could not choose what classes i'd like to take, the driver of the car before me could not choose which lane they wanted to be in, and which blinker to keep on.
startled, i pulled away and ahead of the wobbly car, but by then the puddles had lost their glimmer and left me in the dark.

one theory of personality psychology divides personality in three broad categories.
at the bottom are traits, like conscientiousness, agreeabless, etc. which are behaviorial tendencies.
the next level up are values and motivations. 
whereas traits describe how someone behaves, motivations describe _why_. 
finally, there is the narrative identity.

narrative identity is how we understand ourselves and each other. 
we thread events in our past into coherent stories. 
where we come from, where we are now, and where we see ourselves going. 

our personal narratives are selective reconstructions of our memories to fit our current beliefs.
given the same set of memories, it's possible to rationalize any number of personal narratives. 

i spent a lot of time last year thinking about who i was, what i wanted, and in general a lot of moral and philosophical stuff, but i can hardly remember what i believed last month, much less what i believed a year ago.
maybe my memory is particularly bad or i'm particularly gullible to new ideas, but i feel like this is true for everyone even if to a lesser degree.

the other remaining possibility is that compared to last year, i really have changed a lot, but i don't remember it very well because it happened gradually and atomically. 
like if you start walking up a path with 1% grade, you're probably not going to notice until an hour later when you look back and suddenly realize that you're 150 ft (`50m`) above where you started. 

personal change is hard to measure because you _can't_ just look back[^2] and see make a visual comparison. 
even though i can feel that i'm a different person from when i started school, it's hard for me to figure out exactly what is different.
what's scary about it is that it's also hard to notice if you've actually been going down.

it's only my first week back from springbreak, but it feels like the 5th. 
i admittedly did not do much over the break, just read a book and binged netflix, so it is the fruits of my own (dis)labor that i'm reaping.

i've had tests and quizzes and projects and people and research projects and reading — i can't help but remember my fall semester, when i had mostly classes that didn't require much work, compared to now, where i'm consistently working ~15 hours a day[^3]. 

sometimes when you get hungry, you _get hungry_. 
i get hungry so fast that my fingers start trembling and i can do nothing but search for food — and i'll eat anything. 
hunger is a wildfire that consumes you unless you consume something else.
it's weird that doesn't really happen with thirst, isn't it? thirst doesn't come in exponentials. it is mild and timid.

this comes in an intellectual flavor, too. 
sometimes you hear about an interesting idea, and it's like you just saw an ad for [insert your preferred drink]. 
all of a sudden your mouth feels dry and you want a sip of what you just heard.

other times, though, other times i'm laying in bed and hunger envelopes me, and you can't resist hunger, so i just do what i must to fill the hole, whether that be in my stomach or in my mind.

it was probably one of those nights last semester that i felt extremely famished and ordered too much.
now there is too much on my plate and i'm staying up to finish it.

but it tastes so good. in hunger, even the lightest bit of seasoning tastes too good to be legal, like sin.
and when you have pringles? _uGH-_ 

the burst of discovery when they coincide with your tongue, the crunch of those devious hyperbolic paraboloids, the revelry and joy as you explore its surface, and the savory aftermath in your mouth.

every time, after i experience art, i see more vividly than theories seem to suggest. 
it sweeps away the dust and breathes color back into my life, a life made monochromatic by classes and psets and code.
who knew that grueling computations literally sucked the soul out of you.

in the summer before college, i made the wise choice of enrolling in a creative writing class. 
the professor wasn't great- she would ramble for a long time without a clear point and teach nothing.

it was a great class, in theory, but for the whole semester i felt like i was thrashing around in a pool of fog, and i just wanted to get to the other side and be done.

sometimes though, i'd read something touching, and the fog would lift for a moment and i would see the dazzling shoreline on the other side, draped in lights, and i'd see the starry sky above.
but mostly, it was a foggy blur.

that first semester, i had also elected some other courses which i thought would be engaging but turned out to be not.
all but two of my classes felt like a waste of time, but i found out i enjoyed math, so when i picked my schedule for the current semester, i made sure it was packed with math and physics.

i badly wanted some structure in my life, something reliable to lean on.
but i'd overcompensated: in the fall, i read poems, wrote some too. i went out to performances with friends and let novelty guide me to any event. 
maybe my world was out of focus, maybe it was enveloped in smoke, but the smoke caught color from the shore and, with every breathe, filled me with it, too.
i didn't know where i was going or what i was doing, but it felt beautiful.
now, my world is sharper, sharpened by one definition after another.
block by block, i transformed the ground under my feet into an n x n grid and i'm making measured progress.
yet the little shore with the colorful lights is gone, so is the sky,
and somehow still the fog remains, a cloud of black and white.

my situation isn't as miserable as it sounds- i'm having fun, truly, with math and physics. 
despite what most people may think, there is a lot of beauty, exploration, and creativity.
it is not just analytical thinking and problem-solving.
at a higher level, it creates the same response that art does, but it is a more stoic, enlightening, transcendental kind of beauty, mostly[^4].
the burning out is real- enjoyment is there, too, but it does not come freely. one must work for it.

it's like there's a minimum error between focus and color, like the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), and i can't have 100% of both. 
when there's lots to look at, i can't pick out anything in particular, and the harder i try to look, the less there is to see.
how stupid is this!

all my life, i've struggled to find a group where i would really fit in. 
some of it was... circumstantial, but i'd wager a majority chunk of the reason is because i'm picky.
some people are too much this and others too little that, and i could never find a "just right".

well duh, on two levels:
duh 1- no one i meet is ever going to feel perfect.
duh 2- (imagine i'm gesturing to weigh these concepts):
romanticism...stoicism, math...art, focus...color, writing a blog...sleeping before 2am. 
i hardly know what i'm looking for, so how would i ever find it?[^5]

even though this is probably a romantic illusion that doesn't actually exist, i think it illustrates 

it can be hard, even, to know where you are at. 
i did not realize how much i'd changed until i wrote [#6](#6).
without a reference point, it's very easy to lose track of where you are.

i have many wants, probably a literal infinite amount of them. 
i want to write and i want to sleep and i want to read poems and math books and be good a what i do and enjoy life and be emotional but not sentimental.
i want to hang out with friends and be active in my communities instead of being that person who is always "too busy".
i want all of these things and more, but there is only so much time.

we're creatures of comparison. 
it happens automatically without trying.
hobbies.. research... passions... writing... math.. coding... impostor syndrome comes so easily, from every walk of life.
if you don't get impostor syndrome from comparing with people in the immediate vicinity, then it's trivial to broaden your scope until everything you've done pales in comparison.

this is obviously a super unhealthy way to motivate myself, but i'm also not really willing to give up ambition.
it's hard to give up the idiosyncratic bits about ourselves that make us different from others, that makes us stand out.
surely, there's a balance?

i tried to curb my guilt by focusing on present things and stop worrying, but ironically, the drive to be [rid of perfectionism](https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/08/10/the-perfectionism-trap) and to optimally balance ones life is in itself a kind of perfectionism. 
i found myself feeling guilty for making comparisons, critiquing myself for overthinking and worrying too much. 
there's always something to judge
the cycle never ends! 

i asked a highly-regarded physicist at [FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu) for advice on figuring out what i'm interested in. 
he asked "What are you good at?"
i blanked and panicked- what _was_ i good at? 
i replied that i didn't know, but he didn't let it go.

"Are you good at coding?"
me? good at coding? i guess i've done some projects here and there, but it's nothing special.

"i'm okay," i said. 

"are you being modest? don't- no don't be modest, i'm asking." 

"no. i-... i'm really just decent."

"okay. are you good at analytic stuff? like pencil and paper?"

a blank stare. i recounted all the times in the past semester where i'd given the same stare to an ODE quiz. 
certainly i was better at coding than algebra.

"erm.. no, i wouldn't say i'm talented in that."

i've thought about this interaction a lot since it happened. 
at first, i felt humiliated, not because he meant to interview me on my strengths, but because he'd unwittingly exposed what i was most afraid of— mediocrity.

i am at a crossroad in life where, no matter what i do, i'll be able to construct a personal narrative in the future which rationalizes my choices.
if i want, the pressure to choose can disappear altogether. 
or, alternatively, i can conjure up an infinite set of choices and spend all day in decision paralysis.

some of these paths are treacherous hikes through grad school, then academia, filled with all the worries i've already spilled in these pages.
some are happy, stress-free, a life dedicated to joy instead of "impact".

when i picture these worlds, it is always through someone elses' eyes that i look and judge. 
"here, this guy isn't isn't doing anything useful with his life. he's not good at anything."
or, "who let him become a professor? he's making such little progress on a problem someone else could probably solve easily."

this is the crux of the matter: i'm okay with living a normal, peaceful life, but i'm afraid of being seen as mediocre, and giving up my identity(ies).
classic impostor syndrome.


[^1]: if you or a loved one wants to start writing, all you have to do is to get sad and then think deeply about your experience to see if there's anything valuable or interest you can extract from it. it's not like sadness is in short supply.
[^2]: some people seem to have a much better idea of where they're at relative to their past. if you're one of these supernatural people, i envy you and please tell me how you do it.
[^3]: for all of high school, i slept around 8-9 hours a day, but i'm gradually trying to reduce my sleep hours to squeeze more time out for work. frankly, if i hadn't slept less this week, i wouldn't have gotten everything done.
[^4]: there is this really great book called "Mathematics for Human Flourshing", by Francis Su,  which talks about all the ways that math satisfies human needs. one of the chapters is beauty, and in it the author describes four different types of beauty. the sensory, wondrous, insightful, and transcent beauties. you should read it, even you think you don't like math. 
[^5]: i recently found [this blog](https://nicoles.substack.com/p/finding-the-right-people) that has a good take on being intentional with your choice of friends. mostly, it suggests choosing to hang out with people who are admirably different from me, "free in ways that you're not", learning small things from each person you admire.
