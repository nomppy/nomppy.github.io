we spoke with the candor unique to two people who will never have anything to do with each other again. only six months have gone by, but we might as well have been strangers zipping past each other on an intergalactic subway. 

i told myself i would let go of my attachment to the outcome of our conversation &mdash; and for the most part, i did &mdash; but i couldn't shake the hope of reconnecting with someone and having access to a whole branch of possibilities at a different corner of the universe. 

i picked up my ex today to say our goodbyes, as im leaving for college very soon. we went to starbucks and then aimlessly drove around the suburbs, meandering in the way that people do when they have nowhere to go, and we talked.

we caught up on the important things that happened &mdash; apparently he was having a really shitty summer. we talked about the past, acknowledged our mistakes, the same things you say to yourself when you look back on a time you weren't so proud about. i should've done this.. i feel bad about that.. i was just... 

we laughed about silly people and circumstances, shared our dreams for the future, and talked about our want to grow as people. the bright side of life.

he told me about his horrible breakup with his latest ex, who lied, ghosted, and probably cheated on him. he told me about his paranoia and depression, how he sometimes hears voices and sees people that aren't there. he tried to kill himself, and his mom flew across the country to pick him up from the hospital. the dark side of life.

for a brief few hours, i was reintroduced into a completely different life. a horrid, harsh, depressing peek at the ugly reality churning several thousand meters below the surface. the worst part was that i couldn't do anything about it. i was an utterly powerless bystander. 

i had missed it. everything about it. his voice, his mannerisms, the way his eyelids fluttered when he was deep in thought. it was the best conversation i'd had in a long time. and as sad as it was, i also missed having a window into a life that was so different from mine.

i said that i hoped we could stay in touch, and he said that was unlikely. there was no particular reason for it, since we agreed that we've both matured, and he didn't dislike any part of me. 

it was a perfectly nice day. i drove to his house. we shook hands. he got out, and that's the last i ever saw of him. the sky remained serene, and the trees were no more and no less vibrant than before. 

when i got home. i grieved for our lost connection, for the terrible things he's gone through, his lost of innocence, and for the others who are just as fucked up as him.

i thought about what a terrible thing it was that people go through this shit, how they have to deal with symptoms that don't go away their entire life, and with luck, tuck away the ugliness from people like me who were fortunate enough to not have experienced it.

then i thought about my ideals for the world, with kind people everywhere and everyone wanting the best for each other &mdash; a united humankind &mdash; and cried when i realized that you can't build something when the building blocks are broken.
