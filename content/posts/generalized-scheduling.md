i really need to journal. i cant even remember the last time i seriously reflected. nearly a month deep into summer now, i find myself interacting with only a small selection of friends. im not meeting new people and im not deepening existing relationships, either, with the exception of an influx of french people who i quickly grew tired of texting.

texting is no way to grow relationships. it’s half decent for maintaining already-close ones, but it gets boring and trivial for not so intimate relationships.

and texting, of course, is what ive mostly done. i think the only people ive actually talked to, excluding graduation parties, are paula, suchit, ming, nate, shae, garrett, mike, and jack. it isnt that i cant see people in person or call them, so clearly i lack a desire to do so, but why?

one reason could be that i have enough close social interactions and any more would not be meaningful. i’m also dedicating much time to studying physics, psychology, and other personal activities, which i prioritize more than random hangouts.

i have a problem with setting aside a task and picking it up later. when planning my schedule, i send an email and frequently check to see if theres been a response. when suggesting plans to friends, i constantly check to see if they have responded.

needless to say, this is obtrusive to productivity, though i’ve formed such a habit of it that i would need conscious effort to stop. i like finishing one thing before moving on to the next, but that shouldn’t stop me from doing other things while waiting for input from other people.

a good question to ask, then, is when i should check for emails or texts, and a good reminder for me is that the vast majority of things are not urgent to the day. by that i mean nothing changes if i see it a day or even days later. the whole advantage of planning ahead is the leisurely pace it affords you, compared to last minute scrambling, so why waste that time being pointlessly frantic? almost all messages can wait at least 8 hours. there is no sense in deliberately checking unless you anticipate something time sensitive, like meeting a friend or something. 

i’ve just turned off messages and insta notifications from appearing in the notification center. this, combined with do not disturb - should make the checking habit less of a problem.

back to the original problem of talking to friends. i think this just means i should be making more calls in place of texts. i will optimize dnd settings for that and start calling people.

i struggled with understanding the derivation of the lorentz transformations, so i’m feeling a bit stupid. it shouldn’t be difficult to understand, but these derivations seem to just require a lot of elementary algebra. 

alas, i still feel like i’m not doing enough. relative to all the personal things i wanted to do this summer, my current progress looks small in comparison. let’s look at what i want to do and maybe set some goals.

---

**writing -** other than reflective journaling and emotion dumping (which i call poems), what else is there to write? i occasionally use writing to explore some thoughts, but at the moment there is nothing consistent to write about or for on the daily. this is part of the reason i want to complete my website to accomodate writing pieces. then i could do things like screenwriting, playwriting, short stories, poems, etc.

if an outlet is what im missing, then i need to set a goal for myself to have that finished and actively work on it.

**physics and psych** **-** i’m actually doing ok on these, i think. last weeks’ birthday plans threw things off the track but i’m making steady progress in my academic pursuits. the only problem is getting distracted, which i’ve already accounted for in the first section.

**reading -** *middlemarch* is starting to pick up, i think, although i need to remember / set aside time for reading. the same goes for writing, actually. 

**french -** i want to be fluent in french, and the best way forward seems to be speaking with native french speakers, who i have an abundance of. 

**piano -** i certainly don’t want to forget all about the piano. practicing can definitely be menial and boring, but a half hour isn’t much at all.

i think i’m fairly competent at managing committed time, like classes or mandatory tasks, but managing free time is a little harder for me. i don’t think i could set and abide by a strict routine that says when and for how long i should dedicate to an activity. something like “physics for two hours, then writing for one, followed by half an hour of reading” won’t work because it puts an arbitrary time limit on your interest. even a minimum-time schedule (”… physics for at least an hour”) seems to imply to your brain that you’re forcing yourself to do the activity without actually wanting to do it. with a time-based schedule like this, you’re also prone to feeling bad when you miss a goal, something that is likely given how many there will end up being in a single day. 

so strictly time-based schedules seem to be a dead-end, but doing things by complete whim — that is, purely based on spontaneous interesting — has proven to make inconsistent progress and carries a high risk of being derailed by easier entertainment.

the problem might be that i have too many things i want to do, all in the same day. it’s difficult for me to consistently hit writing, physics, psych, reading, and coding all in the same day without creating a schedule, which i want to avoid. perhaps a better solution would be a generalization of the system i have already set up for physics, psych, and coding, where each of the subjects are assigned a day of the week. on that day, i should spend a satisfactory amount of effort in that day’s subject. other activities are done spontaneously. 

the key is that there isn’t any routine i have to follow. no minimum time requirements or maximum time limits. suppose i had only one activity of interest. doing sufficient work on that would be trivial because it’s the only thing to do! having two is just as easy to manage, given how much free time i have right now. three requires a slight bit of juggling, but is definitely doable. but imagine trying to learn physics and psychology, practice french and the piano, read books, journal, and write a website all in the same day! 

there is a limit to how many things one can juggle in a finite amount of free time. perhaps with more practice, one can learn to juggle more things, but for me, for now, that amount seems to be around 3.

i suppose an easy way to create a generalized schedule is to assign activities to big chunks of time. currently i have physics on monday, pyshcology on tuesday, and coding on wednesday. these days are still totally free for any other interests that might occur, but with a concentration or focus on the assigned subject.

with a little reassignment based on interest, my generalized schedule might look like this

| mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat | sun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physics | psych | physics | psych | physics | psych | unallocated / make up |
| tech/website | french | piano | tech/website | french | piano | unallocated / make up |

i still need to assign reading and writing, but im not sure how i should fit them in. this is when i imagine any day with two assigned activities plus reading, to start. if that feels like too much, i would need to find another way to do it, but i can comfortable add reading as a third activity to any one of these days and feel good about it. so we have:

| mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat | sun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physics | psych | physics | psych | physics | psych | unallocated / make up |
| tech/website | french | piano | tech/website | french | piano | unallocated / make up |
| reading | reading | reading | reading | reading | reading | reading |

writing is a little trickier. as i don’t have a definitive project to work on right now, i will only feel comfortable writing when inspiration strikes, which makes assigning it a day a risky business. for now, i’ll leave space for journaling — mostly as a reminder and falls back to reading. so the final generalized schedule looks like this:

| mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat | sun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physics | psych | physics | psych | physics | psych | unallocated / make up |
| tech/website | french | piano | tech/website | french | piano | unallocated / make up |
| reading | reading | journal | reading | reading | journal | unallocated / make up |

i think this method of time organization — assigning a few focus areas to a day on a rotation where higher interest items have more frequent days — outperforms scheduling hours of a day where higher interest items have longer hours. my approach allows for greater flexibility due to unforeseen circumstances or the natural web and flow of interest, as well as encouraging greater spontaneity. 

the way to evaluate this schedule would be to look at the relative frequencies of each item. higher means more interested. physics and psych are each assigned to 50% of days, whereas tech/website is only on 1/3 of days.

the relative % interest of an item can be calculated by dividing its total number of appearances over total blocks. although here another problem arrises: blocks are not created equal. i created this schedule with the implicit knowledge that on any given day, the academic focus will be more intensive than reading. even in the same row/rotation, activities do not hold equal time commitment. a website-focused day might expect to receive at least an hour of work, but i do not intend to do the same for the piano. 

one way to fix this is by placing all items of the same level of single-session time commitment into the same rotation, and modifying overall time commitment by adding additional rotations of less significance. one can then build a picture of overall time distribution by finding the weighted sum of an item’s frequency in its rotation, multiplied by the weight of that rotation.

what that means graphically is that physics, psych, and website should all belong in the same rotation, since they feel to require about the same level of time and energy each time. since they have the highest single-session expenditures, i will call this rotation the “primary focus”. omitting sunday since we have already designated it as a make-up day:

|  | mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| primary focus | physics | psych | tech/web | physics | psych | tech/web |

i think tech/web and pysch are in a good spot, but i’d like to do more physics. how can i do this without displacing the other two primary focuses? the answer is to create another physics block as a secondary focus.

i have a good idea of how much effort i would put in a day on learning french and the piano, and the amount of additional time i’d like to spend on physics matches pretty well with that. so i can create another rotation, “secondary focus”, containing physics, french, and piano:

|  | mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| primary focus | physics | psych | tech/web | physics | psych | tech/web |
| secondary focus | french | piano | physics | piano | french | physics |

why i chose this order of rotation: i want an academic focus every day, so i placed secondary physics under primary tech/web. i then had two pairings of physics/french and psych/piano, and i swapped one of them for greater diversity in pairings, which i hope will enable better discover of serendipitous connections between different areas. 

i still need to assign reading and journaling, but actually i think they have similar expenditure to french and piano as well. nothing prevents me from creating another secondary focus rotation, this time containing reading and writing. this one is special in that it really is something i should be doing everyday, so i will actually name it “invariant focus”, to show that it is independent of local fluctuations in interest (as might be the case with tech/web once the website is finished).

|  | mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| primary focus | physics | psych | tech/web | physics | psych | tech/web |
| secondary focus | french | piano | physics | piano | french | physics |
| invariant focus | reading | writing → reading | reading | reading | reading | writing → reading |

et voila! a schedule to easily and effectively juggle time usage between many interests — without creating a daily schedule that is difficult to follow.

## experimental:

one can conceivably create any desired focus distribution and fine-tune the total expenditure of an item by creating many rotations of different levels. an important thing to note is that slots need not be filled — blank spots are perfectly acceptable. they will just create days of differing workload which is probably preferable anyway.

an example is shown:

|  | mon | tues | weds | thurs | fri | sat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| primary focus | physics | psych | tech/web | physics | psych | tech/web |
| primary focus |  |  | physics |  | french |  |
| secondary focus | french | piano |  | piano | piano | reading |
| invariant focus | reading | writing → reading | reading | reading | reading | writing → reading |

physics is now a primary focus in 1/2 of days, while
