Some people, when you lose them,  
it’s like the world has lost its color, the food its taste,  
and all the characters you’ve been playing dies.  
There is only you, the melodrama addict, and  
at once you imagine a world where you hadn’t been born.  
How freeing would that be?

A few weeks later, someone else leaves  
with a part of your soul that they weren’t supposed to keep.  
You chase after them — because of course you do — it’s a cliché,  
but running after a person is like trying to catch a breeze.  
“It’s not the end of the world” sounds more like a threat than a reassurance.

But then, you remember.  
There are millions of other colors in your world, millions of other stars.  
So the Romeo who did not die professes his love once more,  
and the Little Prince whispers in your ear a string of silver-bell laughter,  
which makes you feel lighter than a feather and pinker than a rose.  

Eventually you turn around and stitch back the fragments of your soul.  
From broken shards, in each edge a memory of what could’ve been,  
you piece together a mirror with too many cracks.
