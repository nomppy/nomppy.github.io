Dear Cupid,


I've been thinking about love a lot lately — what is it? 
How does it work? 
How do we find it? 
I used to think that I would know love when I feel it, but now I'm not so sure.

I had love, once. 
When I was in grade school I once held someone's hand as we walked home from school together. 
Our walk was short — just the distance from our bus stop to his house — but on the way we would pass by the Harbingers' house. 
The Harbingers loved nature, and this you could tell just by looking at their front lawn, which was more like a garden, actually. 
The old couples must've taken extreme care to litter their yard with the most exotic and vibrant fauna, as their entire property rested under the small forest's canopy.
The house itself was not grand, but it was like nature's cradle.
It had a base of mossy granite, and the rest built from weathered fern wood. 
Luscious, green ivy crawled up one side, almost covering the wall entirely, and wrapped itself around the chimney, spiralling higher and higher.
They mustn't have lit their furnace in ages, in fear of hurting the vegetation on the chimney.
Each time we walked by, we couldn't help but vaguely feel that such a house did not belong here, but rather on an Airbnb listing for "vintage cabin in the South of France", or whatever the French equivalent of Airbnb is.
Walking past their house made you feel like you were in a secret forest.

The Harbingers' house was undoubtedly my favorite part of the whole walk home. 
We'd slow our pace to barely an amble and stop before their house, their hand in mine. 
We'd stand there a moment to catch our breath and admire the serene view.
Neither of us ever spoke — it was an unspoken rule that one did not disturb the peace with clumsy words.
Only once we've left the house behind would we chat excitedly about when we were going to get married and how our English teacher, Ms. Finnegan, had see-through hair and how, when we became grey-haired and saggy bones, we would live in a house just like the Harbingers'.

I feel guilty to admit that when the Harbingers died, I didn't even notice. 
It wasn't until two months later, when the unruly grass spilled onto the road and green exploded from the chimney, completely covering the roof, that their grandchildren swooped in and inherited the house. 
The grandchildren were stockbrokers. 
Efficient, hard-working people. 
In the same week, they'd found an interested tenant, who kindly requested that "all the shrubbage" be removed, and within the month, the old Harbingers' house was now just another old house on the block. 
Somehow, with the Harbingers' death and the death of their house, it felt unnatural to hold each other's hands in front of the now foreign landscape.
After all, who knew what kind of people the grandchildren had found.
Soon after, we found that we ran out of things to say, until finally I rode our bus an extra stop to avoid the awkward silence and walked home alone.

These days I often wonder, did I have reasons for falling in love, or did I fall in love first and came up with the reasons later? 
Isn’t love just a bunch of chemicals shooting around in your brain? — chemicals engineered by your genes to make you feel good and thereby continuing to make more copies of your genes. 
It’s a horrible trick that my genes have played on me, because I don’t have a single idea on how I might find love, and if I’m even in control of who I fall in love with.

We humans are silly — falling in love knowing it must inevitably end in heartbreak.
Now I’m not sure I’d recognize love even if it was right in front of me or if I could ever be in love again, or if I did fall in love if it would ever be more real than boosted levels of serotonin and dopamine. 
I’m not sure at all, at least where another person is concerned. 



Sincerely,  
Yours
