Every once in a while I lay down to sleep and instead fall into a reflective mood, and start thinking about my past â€” what I would change, knowing what I know now.

I often give the same pieces of advice to multiple people, or think the same thoughts on different occasions, so today I decided to write them down. This, by the way, is my first bit of advice, **learn to write well and write often**.

Writing is, in my opinion, a skill as fundamental as walking or breathing. A lot more can be and has been said about [why] [writing] [matters], but the key reasons are: writing helps you think better, learn more, share your thoughts, connect with others, and in writings like this, learn about yourself and discover what you believe in.
Also, written communication skills are necessary if you intend on living amongst other humans.

You don't have to be a novelist or a poet to write. You don't even have to write well. Everyone has at least one interesting thought every week that is worth writing down.
If nobody else can make sense of your writing, that's okay, as long as you know what you're talking about.
Don't confuse this with writing a long rant with no context though. At a bare minimum, anything you write needs to be understandable to you days after you write it.

Find out when your writing brain is most active. Your writing brain is the one that's not concerned with the logistics of day-to-day life, what you have to do, when to eat, whether your friend hates you or not. Rather, it surfaces at the edges of days, after all your survival needs have been met. 
For me, this is most reliably right before I sleep, and also frequently when doing a mindless activity during the day. I like to think of this as the unleashing of subconscious observations, released only when you're not occupied with other things.
Many writers throughout history report the early morning as the best time for them, but this seems to vary by person with no way of switching between times. Find your own and make use of it.



reflect frequently
write things down
be satisfied in the present
