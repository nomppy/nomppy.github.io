Memory â€” died on a Thursday. I probably had school that day. If so, then I came home to a summer house in the pit of winter. The air smelled stale and metallic. The walls were painted a hostile maroon and echoed back the silence. The doors had hinges that groaned and opened the wrong way. Furniture after furniture vanished in the wake of my father, then the bruises that I used to cover with makeup, followed by my memory, until eventually there were just four corners and a wall where my father splashed crimson.
