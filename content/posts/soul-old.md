Some people, when you lose them,  
it’s like the world has lost its color, the food its taste,  
and all the characters you’ve been playing dies.  
There is only you, the melodrama addict, and  
at once you imagine a world where you hadn’t been born.  
How freeing would that be? A great weight off everyone’s chest as they heave a collective sigh.  

A few weeks later, someone else leaves  
with a part of your soul that they weren’t supposed to keep.  
You chase after them — because of course you do — it’s a cliché,  
but running after a person is like trying to catch a breeze.  

A few days later, she dies.  
When “It’s not the end of the world” sounds more like a threat than a reassurance,  
you curse the sun for rising when it should come crashing down with the rest of the sky.  

But then you remember there are millions of other colors in your world, millions of other stars.  
So the Romeo who did not die professes his love once more,  
and the Little Prince whispers in your ear a string of silver-bell laughter,  
which makes you feel lighter than a feather and pinker than a rose.  

Eventually you realize that running is harder than waiting and,  
waiting is harder than turning around and  
stitching back the fragments of your soul.  
You stop chasing, stop crying,  
stop doubting, stop thinking,  
stop reacting, stop hurting.  
You harden your skin to keep them from prying.  

I secretly think that we all play a bunch of characters,  
and that every time we get really, really sad,  
the melodramatic one picks someone else to kill forever.  
Year after year after year, death after death,  
a part of you dies, and the rest are revived.  
And that is how I think a soul is made.
