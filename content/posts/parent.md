Sometimes I dislike someone but don't venture to explain why.
It is because I know too intimately where that icky stuff comes from. 
And I am afraid it will cover me once again.

Dear Mom,

You see, strictly logically speaking, I know that I am the center of your world. 
I sense that hidden amidst all the shaming, and the questioning, and pissing me off, there is — somehow, somewhere, inexplicably — love.
But I have my own world to attend to, a world disjoint from yours, and in my hubris I dare proclaim myself the sole expert on this subject.
Yet always, _always_, the underlying implication that I cannot be entrusted to myself. 

"You grow up to be the person you would've felt safe around as a child." — I read once, while scrolling on instagram. 
If I stare at this long enough, tears start to collect over my eyes.

If I stared at you long enough, I start to cry.

When I look in the mirror, it's me, but it's you. 
Parts of you, staring back at me, crying, laughing, sneering. 
I look like you, they say, "Children grow up to be like their parents."

_God... I hope not. I'd hoped to be the person I would've felt safe with as a child._

I get it. You're the big donor to the campaign of my life. 
Yes, you can choose to meddle in my elections. And yes, there is little I can do about it. 
Yes, you can kick me, threaten me, and guilt me, and yes, I will probably, eventually, unwillingly submit. 
But I think I am not alone in wishing that you took some time to ask more questions. 
Not in the quietly self-assuming way that teachers ask questions, but like a visiting scholar touring some strange lab for the first time.
Ask me questions that I'd be proud to answer.

Ask me, and I'll tell you everything.

Sometimes you want someone to know that you became you in spite of them.
Like, "Look, you had no effect over me. Your influence was nothing to me."
This is, however, impossible when it comes to parents.
It's like radiation, and the best we can often do is get away from the source.

My friend Lia sent me this today:

> why does walking past my father in the kitchen feel like seeing a childhood bestfriend on the street?  
> the nod that says 'i knew you, but i don't think i need to anymore'

Maybe our lives would be sweeter if we imagined our relationship with our parents as a sitcom. 
It's at least a little bit funny, in the morbid way that the submarine is funny, how the universe insists on having two complete strangers eat food which was cooked on the same stove, in bowls washed by the same hands.

Dear Dad,

Trust me when I say that I was really hungry that night.
In my hunger, I wandered to the kitchen in search of some strawberry ice cream, and it was there that I found you, standing there in front of the fridge in your llama pajamas. 

In your hand was the pint of ice cream I climbed out of bed for. 
You didn't see me, I think, for I might've been hiding in the walls.
And I pretended not to see you, as well, except to observe how naturally your eyes swept over my little spot in the wall. 
I dared not call out your name, to ask for a portion of my ice cream, for what if your ears perked up but you didn't hear me? 

I returned to my bedroom empty-handed, and too hungry to sleep.
On the bedside table is the watch you gave me for my 12th birthday.

"To keep you punctual."

I turned it over in my hand, and put it in my mouth gingerly.
It tasted a little like old attic, and more oily than I would've liked, but I chewed on it thoughtfully.
When that was done, I reached for another, and then another. 

In my infinite hunger, I ate piece-by-piece everything you ever gave me.
I ate the leather wallet you got me when I turned 16. 
I ate the mug that says "This mug is a hug from dad".
They tasted mostly of nothing, and I think I was a little disappointed by this. 
I ate my glasses, the cord bracelet on my wrist, and all the bad jokes you've ever made. 
They all turned to air when I bit down.
I hate the way you turned into air when I needed you (that was a freudian slip, I meant "ate").
Ate your fights with mother, ate the obsession with your career, ate through the way you fight for control. 
It was disgusting and vile, but I kept putting in more and more, and now everything had conglomerated into a mushy ball, pushing against my cheeks with bits of leather and blood spilling out. 

I wanted to throw up — but couldn't. 

...

Then, I woke up. 
There was nothing in my mouth but the remnant memory of something bitter. 

"Bad dream?" your eyebrows seemed to ask.

_Yes, but how can I tell you? We speak only in metaphors._

"No, I just dreamed of ice cream."
