rachmaninoff's [c sharp minor prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcG-DnGdWRw) is one of my favorite pieces to play, because beyond fulfilling that urge that all piano players have to smash the keys every once in a while, it is also a piece that changes form depending on my mood when i play it. we say that an actor has range if they can convincingly play a broad set of characters. well, the c minor prelude has range.

it starts like an alarm. 3 octaves of c minor in fortissimo is sure to wake up any audience member dozing off in the concert hall. then, the way the second note is played sets the tone for the remaining sentence (but notably, not the entire piece). am i feeling mournful? or enraged? calm and collected, or do anxious signals already leak in from the second half?

the story of this piece was passed down to me by my piano teacher. it is said that rach had a nightmare where he was at a friend's funeral, hence the first part with rich, sombre tones, and as he walks down the aisle towards the coffin his anxiety builds and becomes agitated until — he opens the coffin — and it is himself lying dead inside! it is said that the c minor prelude is a transcription of the music he heard in this nightmare.

i’m not a loud person. i am also not an angry person. 
i feel these things, of course i do — when im angry words form in my head and i imagine myself articulating to another person all the reasons why i was mad at them. i can see myself doing it, but as soon as i pull out of my head i find that i dont know how to be loud, or angry. rach’s c minor is sometimes the best way i have to say things that i cant say, in a way that i cant mimic.

do i have an anger problem? no, you’re probably thinking of rach. the man’s pieces did consist of expansive, almost entirely fortissimo chords. 
not the entire time, though, the middle parts in c minor and g minor (my other favorite prelude) both feature soft, delicate melodies that can be played to suit your mood. 

rach’s own interpretation has a rather calm start. in contrast with more modern interpretations by modern pianists, it feels peaceful, final, and you could even mistake it for sadness if you didn't know what was coming next. 
then, after a quick breath, he starts “walking down the aisle” and almost immediately one can sense that something is wrong. 
the rhythm doesn't feel quite aligned, the pace quickens, the anxiety builds exponentially (in the e^x sense, not just the english word for “very quickly”), and altogether the notes sound like they are hyperventilating and falling down the stairs at the same time. 
in one long, breathless, crescendo, all of the pent-up frustrations, grudges, rage, and hate collapse into each other and— DUUNNNN — rach shortens the lifespan of the c minor chord keys by half. 
i’m sure that if pianos could have multiple sets of hammers, with varying hardness for varying volumes, rach would’ve used actual hammers.

i breathe. maybe that's obvious. but you breathe too, and now you’re aware of it. that’s me whenever i try to confront someone. 
suddenly it becomes imperative that i devote brain resources to voluntary respiration instead of articulating what i wanted to say. 
i have the words: i could write them down right now. 
but as soon as the situation which i've been playing in my head forwards and back starts playing out in real life, the words and emotions realize that there’s no path from the brain to the mouth, and i become mute. 

rach's finale repeats the chords from the first part, but with double the notes and at double the volume (my book literally has two octaves for each hand in this final section). 
rach had _enormous_ hands which could cleanly span a **13th**, or from a C to the G an octave higher. his hands were at least as big as shaq o'neal's, if not bigger (if you're wondering how people play his pieces, [this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKKlhYF53w)). 

after approximately 70 seconds of abusing the piano, the abuse ends as quickly as it had started. 
all the rage dissipated, serenity is restored, the terror and tension fades into nothing as rachmaninoff presumably woke up from his nightmare or something.
that is perhaps the scariest form of anger. calm, exponential growth until it explodes, and then dies away to nothing.
when i play this piece, however, i always get the feeling towards the end that the resolution is not a result of satisfaction, but one of powerlessness. 
i tend to play the ending with a touch of bitter resignation, as if all of the previous work hasn't produced the desired result, like you've run out of steam, not that all the steam actually did anything. as if this, too, this wordless expression of what i want to say is futile. 
in the end, the words are thoughts in my head and the emotions are chords on the keys.
