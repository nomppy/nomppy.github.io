rachmaninoff's [c sharp minor prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcG-DnGdWRw) (i _highly recommend_ listening along) is one of my favorite pieces to play[^1].
because beyond fulfilling that urge that all piano players have to smash the keys every once in a while, it is also a piece that transforms depending on the mood of the player,
which means it can be extraordinarily sad one phrase and extraordinarily angry the next. 

it starts like an alarm — 3 octaves played at _fortissimo_ is enough to wake up any audience member dozing off in the concert hall.
by the second set of chords, the tone is set for the remainder of the movement. 
is it mournful? enraged? calm and collected, or anxious and fidgety? 

it is said that rach had a nightmare where he was at a friend's funeral, hence the first part with rich, sombre chords, and as he walks down the aisle towards the coffin his anxiety builds and becomes agitated until — he opens the coffin — and he finds himself lying dead inside!

when he awoke from his nightmare he immediately tried to capture the funeral song which accompanied his dream, which became this prelude.

i’m not a loud person. i am also not an angry person. 
i feel these things, of course — i imagine myself yelling at someone for all the things they did to piss me off, _all the time_.

i can see myself doing it, but as soon as i pull out of my head, i find that, in reality, i don't know _how_ to be loud, or angry, and i lose my words. 

it could be a roommate i just can't stand.
maybe it's an ex, who i think is dead but who is somehow still alive elsewhere.
or maybe it's my mom, who's one-ear-in and one-ear-out.

how do you yell at someone if they can't hear you?

rach’s own interpretation has a rather calm start in stark contrast with more modern interpretations. 
it feels peaceful, final, mournful.

as he starts “walking down the aisle”, almost immediately one can sense that something is wrong. 
the rhythm in the left and right hand misalign to build anxiety exponentially (in the e^x sense, not just the English word for “very quickly”), and altogether the notes sound like they are hyperventilating and falling down the stairs at the same time. 
then in one long, breathless crescendo, all of the pent-up frustrations, grudges, rage, and hate collapse on top of each other[^2] and — <em class='hl'> DUUNNNN </em> — rach shortens the lifespan of the c minor chord keys fully by half.

i think that, were he given the choice, rach would've used actual hammers in the piano.

i breathe. maybe that's obvious. but you breathe too, and now you’re aware of it. 
and that’s basically me whenever confrontation comes to mind.

suddenly it becomes imperative that i devote brain resources to voluntary respiration instead of articulating what i wanted to say. 

i have the words: i could write them down right now. 
but as soon as the situation which i've been playing in my head forwards and back starts playing out in real life, the words and emotions realize that there’s no path from the brain to the mouth, and i become mute[^3].

rach's finale repeats the chords from the beginning, but with double the notes and at double the volume[^4]. 
rach had _enormous_ hands which could cleanly span a **13th**, or from a C to the G an octave higher. his hands were at least as big as shaq o'neal's, if not bigger (if you're wondering how people play his pieces, [this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKKlhYF53w)). 

<article-image src='rach-sfff.png' alt='score of the c sharp minor prelude. it looks very loud'> </article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> <em> sfffffff </em> -or- "slam your hand into the piano as hard as you physically can while still hitting most of the notes"</div>

after approximately 70 seconds of abusing the piano, it ends as abruptly as it had started. 

all the rage dissipated, serenity is restored, the terror and tension fades into nothing (this is where he woke up, presumably).

But _that_, to me, is perhaps the scariest form of anger:
Calm, exponential brewing until it blows up like a volcano, and then dies away as quickly as it had come.

whenever i play this piece, however, i always get the feeling that the resolution is not a result of satisfaction, but one of powerlessness. 
i play the ending with a touch of bitter resignation, as if all of the previous rage still hasn't produced the desired result, like you've run out of steam, but the steam didn't do anything.

as if this, too, this wordless expression of what i wanted to say is futile. 
because in the end, the words are still unspoken thoughts in my head and i've only just hit some chords on the keys. 

 
[^1]: and ironically, one of rach's least favorites. he wrote it when he was 19 and grew to hate playing it after being asked by audiences to play it wherever he went ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_in_C-sharp_minor_(Rachmaninoff)#Reception)).
[^2]: if you're listening along — firstly, i love you — and secondly, _feel_ the music.
[^3]: like last year, when freshie me was furious at my roommate but chose instead to slam the piano, the event which inspired this piece. 
[^4]: (the score literally has two clefs for each hand in this final section)
