rachmaninoff's [c sharp minor prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcG-DnGdWRw) (i _highly recommend_ listening to this if you can) is one of my favorite pieces to play[^and-rach's-least-favorite], because beyond fulfilling that urge that all piano players have to smash the keys every once in a while, it is also a piece that transforms depending on the mood of the player.
it can be extraordinarily sad one phrase and extraordinarily angry the next. 

it starts like an alarm. 3 octaves of fortissimo is enough to wake up any audience member dozing off in the concert hall.
then by the second set of chords, the tone is set for the remainder of the movement. 
am i feeling mournful? enraged? calm and collected, or anxious and fidgety? 

the story of this piece was passed down to me by my piano teacher. 
it is said that rach had a nightmare where he was at a friend's funeral, hence the first part with rich, sombre tones, and as he walks down the aisle towards the coffin his anxiety builds and becomes agitated until — he opens the coffin — and he finds himself lying dead inside! 
it is said that the c minor prelude is a transcription of the music he heard during this nightmare[^no-fair].

i’m not a loud person. i am also not an angry person. 
i feel these things, of course i do — i imagine myself shouting at someone all the things they did to piss me off. 
i can see myself doing it, but as soon as i pull out of my head i find that i dont know how to be loud, or angry, and i lose my words. 

do i have an anger problem? no, you’re probably thinking of rach. the man’s pieces did consist of expansive, almost entirely fortissimo chords.
rach’s own interpretation has a rather calm start in stark contrast with more modern interpretations. 
it feels peaceful, final, and you could even mistake it for sadness if you didn't know what was coming next. 

as he starts “walking down the aisle”, almost immediately one can sense that something is wrong. 
the rhythm in the left and right hand misalign to build anxiety exponentially (in the e^x sense, not just the English word for “very quickly”), and altogether the notes sound like they are hyperventilating and falling down the stairs at the same time. 
in one long, breathless, crescendo, all of the pent-up frustrations, grudges, rage, and hate collapse on top of each other and — <em class='hl'> DUUNNNN </em> — rach shortens the lifespan of the c minor chord keys fully by half.

i think that, were he given the choice, rach would've used actual hammers in the piano.

i breathe. maybe that's obvious. but you breathe too, and now you’re aware of it. 
and that’s basically me whenever i try to confront someone. 
suddenly it becomes imperative that i devote brain resources to voluntary respiration instead of articulating what i wanted to say. 

i have the words: i could write them down right now. 
but as soon as the situation which i've been playing in my head forwards and back starts playing out in real life, the words and emotions realize that there’s no path from the brain to the mouth, and i become mute. 

rach's finale repeats the chords from the beginning, but with double the notes and at double the volume[^facts]. 
rach had _enormous_ hands which could cleanly span a **13th**, or from a C to the G an octave higher. his hands were at least as big as shaq o'neal's, if not bigger (if you're wondering how people play his pieces, [this is how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKKlhYF53w)).

<div class='img-caption'> <em> sff... fffff </em>, or, "slam your hand into the piano as hard as you physically can while still hitting most of the notes"</div>


after approximately 70 seconds of abusing the piano, the abuse ends as quickly as it had started. 
all the rage dissipated, serenity is restored, the terror and tension fades into nothing (this is where he died and woke up, presumably).

But _that_, to me, is perhaps the scariest form of anger. 
Calm, exponential brewing until it blows up in your face, and then dies away as quickly as it'd came.

when i play this piece, however, i always get the feeling that the resolution is not a result of satisfaction, but one of powerlessness. 
i play the ending with a touch of bitter resignation, as if all of the previous rage still hasn't produced the desired result, like you've run out of steam, not that all that steam actually did anything. 

as if this, too, this wordless expression of what i wanted to say is futile. 
in the end, the words are thoughts in my head and the emotions are chords on the keys. 

 
[^and-rach's-least-favorite]: and ironically, one of rach's least favorites. he wrote it when he was 19 and grew to hate playing it after being asked by audiences to play it wherever he went ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_in_C-sharp_minor_(Rachmaninoff)#Reception)).
[^no-fair]: i _also_ have extremely vivid dreams, but there is never an epic soundtrack and it's hard to remember anything upon waking up. to be clear, this is most likely a myth, but i still think it would be cool if the many movies i've generated while sleeping deserve to be written down.
[^facts]: (the score literally has two clefs for each hand in this final section)
