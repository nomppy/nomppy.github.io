If you know me at all, then you know that I'm quite extraverted. If you know me well, then you know that that hasn't always been the case.

when i was younger, merely a couple years younger, i never would've considered myself a leader, or even someone with the potential to be a leader. leader, to me, meant someone who was in charge of things. i didnt like being in charge of things. it seemed tedious and bothersome to me, and people in charge seemed to either hate being in charge, which was bad, or loved being in charge, which was also bad because they were often bad at it.

i had no aspirations to be a leader. i was content with doing what i found interesting in my own life. but now i see that to be a citizen is to be a leader. to be educated is to lead. to promote well-rounded education is to lead. to bring people closer together is to lead. to foster harmony is to lead. to fight for others is to lead. to fight for yourself is to lead.

in school, and for college essays in particular, questions about leadership always terrified me for the simple reason that i did not know what to say. i never considered myself an ounce of a leader -- so how could i possibly talk about being one?

what i got wrong -- and what many schools somehow get wrong in teaching children -- is that leadership is not about having a title or any power that comes with it. i think leadership is too often thought of as this elusive, prestigious quality that only a few can possess. because if not every one can be "a leader", and leadership is a quality that the grown-ups look for, then being a leader is clearly superior to being a non-leader. 

kids know that it is desirable to be a leader without knowing precisely what that means and why it matters. worse, it is so mystifying that sometimes people in "leadership positions" don't even grasp the purpose of their role. it's often piercingly clear when someone possesses the title but not the motive because something just seems *off*. humans are amazingly intuitive at sensing when something isn't right, such is the case when a so-called "leader" isn't really doing anything at all. it's not hard to see right through the sham. 

it wouldn't be so bad if the education system was less prestige-centered. but it isn't, so the admissions' search for "leadership" (originally probably a well-intentioned attempt to look for active and engaged citizens) turns children, desperate to outcompete each other, to pursue leadership role titles however they can. some even go as far as to create new clubs (and thus titles) that serve no real purpose.

talk about a sham. seeing the unfruitful labor of supposed "leadership" made me actively avoid it for several years, and i suspect the experience is not unique to me. when you have no idea what leadership is and you see your peers embody leadership in a way that makes you question why anybody cares about this at all, it's easy to assume that the whole thing isn't worth the energy. it's like if my first exposure to dogs was being chased by one (which did happen), i may grow to favor cats more than dogs (which also did happen), even though that's not a very good example of what dogs are about.
