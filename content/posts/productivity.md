title: How to have a more organized life
description: I am somewhat proud of my high efficiency in getting work done (somewhat, because it's not a default setting), and although most people attribute this to being "smart" or some other unlearnable quality, I think it's more likely to be a symptom of my obsession with keeping an organized life. I rely on digital calendars, planners, todo lists, reading lists, etc., read a lot about life and productivity, and I've come up with various tricks to help me be more satisfied with how I'm living. Hopefully you find them helpful.

# Tools

#### Obsidian
This tool deserves a blog all on its own, so I would be remiss to not mention it here.
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powertool of organization and storing knowledge. Plus, everything is stored in platform-independent Markdown, so you never have to worry about being locked into one platform.

To give a sense of how much Obsidian spans my life, I have pages for: classes, projects, assignments, books, videos, useful tools, poems, essays, stories, journal entries, quotes, task planning, and more.

But to be honest, [Notion] is a more beginner-friendly alternative and probably better suited to you. I've used Notion extensively as well, and it's still definitely a very powerful tool for organization.

#### Calendar apps
How would I ever live without a calendar. If you don't actively use digital calendars, you need to _get on it_.
I won't belabor this too much because it's a simple point that most people get, and the only thing I had to add is [Fantastical Calendar](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). 

Google Calendar is great, but it can't display your Outlook calendar (or at least I haven't figured out how - if you have, please tell me!). I know no one willingly uses Outlook calendar, but there's no painless way to transfer events sent to your Outlook email to GCal, hence Fantastical. 
Fantastical is a 3rd-party app that let's you link both Google and Microsoft Exchange accounts, displaying both calendars.

The only caveat is that you need to pay to use advanced features, such as replying to invitations and changing the color of events. This is why, most of the time, I use it as a read-only calendar and add events in GCal.

# Tips

#### Learning how to be productive â‰  productivity
This is definitely a mistake I've made at some point, more likely at multiple points. Productivity hacks are not a substitute for actually doing work. 
It's definitely possible (and quite easy for some) to spend too much time setting up their workspace or arranging their notebooks, time that could have otherwise been spent working.

It's important to be vigilant, to have an inner compass of sorts, about how you're spending your time. You need to have a sense of how you've spent your day and be able to make course corrections if needed. You need to know, for instance, if you've spent all day "working" but actually got very little work done.

#### Relax,
it's not the end of the world if you didn't get done everything you wanted to do, or miss an assignment, god forbid. Learn from your mistakes and aim to fix them tomorrow. 
If it keeps happening and you begin to feel overwhelmed or burnt out, perhaps consider that your underlying motivations may be flawed. 
I'm not one to lecture about personal philosophy, but even though everyone claims to value happiness, people often make choices that actively undermine happiness in favor of something else, like power or wealth, for example.
