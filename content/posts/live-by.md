title: Things I live by
description: Tools, ideas, tricks, books, etc. that I could not live without, in no particular order.

This post is sort of loosely organized like this:

1. First there are some basic tools fundamental to my functioning
2. They get progressively more niche and abstract, moving into websites and blogs
3. Other stuff like music, poems, and books
4. Probably only [(2)](#naps) will be useful to you

_I will definitely update this every now and then as I come across new stuff, so check back later!_


# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Like [notion](https://notion.so)[^1], but better. 

Very useful if you can't remember something for more than half an hour. 
 
<article-image src='obsidian-tasks.png' alt='a screenshot of a todo list set up in Obsidian. there are too many tasks'>
</article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> what is time </div>

It's also very good for notes.

<article-image src='obsidian-notes.png' alt='screenshot of a note file in obsidian about a math theorem'> </article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> it is much organize. </div>

# Google calendar

Honestly, if you don't use a calendar these days, how do you even live?
Tell _me_ if you become such enlightenment.

# Yabai / skhd 

[Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) is a tiling window manager for mac. 

Macs don't ship with a lot of customizability, but with yabai, your fingers never have to leave the keyboard[^actually...].

Used in conjunction with [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), I can switch apps like crazy.
To go somewhere, I press `cmd + backslash`, which enters app-switch mode, then pressing `m` takes me to messages, `s` takes me to safari, `c` to visual studio code, etc.

I can also open websites this way. 
For instance `shift - c` opens google calendar. 

`e` takes me to [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), which is transparent here due to a setting in yabai:

<article-image src='yabai.png' alt='screenshot of semi-transparent doom emacs'>
</article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> **D O O M**... DON'T PANIC </div>

I imagine there's a lot of potential for skhd for all kinds of keyboard macro shenanigans, my personal configuration files for these (along with other stuff) is github ([dotfiles repo](https://github.com/spesthecat/dotfiles)).

# The schedule send feature

In case you are uninformed, in Gmail and Outlook, you can write an email and schedule it to be sent the next morning, or if you write emails on the weekend (ew gross i'd never do that), for Monday.

It would be an even better feature if I ever remember to use it.

# Naps

Ever since I cut down my nighttime sleep, it's gotten impossible to make it through an entire day awake. 
In this economy, it's impossible to get through a whole day awake anyway.

The key to taking a good nap is to actually NOT fall asleep - if you fall asleep you spend more time trying to wake up. 
If you feel sufficiently tired, you can enter [hypnagogia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia) almost immediately, and wake up in 10 minutes refreshed without falling into deeper sleep.

# Structured procrastination
Discussed more deeply (and wittily) in [this essay](https://structuredprocrastination.com), structured procrastination is the idea that procrastinators will do anything but the most important, pressing task ‚Äî including other tasks.

Procrastination is an (in my opinion) unavoidable phenomenon, but it's amazing how much we can get done in the process of avoiding something in particular.
I've helped so many people in the AP students discord server with physics, whilst avoiding writing an unpleasant essay. 
Where would the world be without procrastinators? 

Stackexchange would not exist.
This website would not exist.
I would not exist.

Long live procrastination.

# [Onelook.com](https://onelook.com)
_Ack-_ what was that word for "strong hatred" that ends with "ma"?

<article-image src='anathema.png' alt='a screenshot of Onelook thesaurus returning a list of words which mean strongly hated, finding anathema'> </article-image>
<div class='img-caption'> it's a real word, a great word </div>

# Z-lib
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüìö: Since the original domain went down, you now need to use [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org) to access its `.onion` domain (I won't tell you how to do this, but you can look it up).
<small class='whisper'> (you also would need to create an account, but then you get _all_ of the books) </small>

# Writing 
_Clearly_, I like writing. 
But it doesn't often come up _why_ I like it so much, or why I make them public for everyone to see.

It boils down to things:
1. Writing helps me understand my own thinking. Talked about a lot on the internet and by writing teachers, writing helps you think better, and it's as simple as that.
2. Writing is the act of shouting "Are you guys seeing this?" about the kind of stuff that would be awkward to bring up normally. 
When you write, you say, "Am I the only one who feels this way?", and sometimes...
3. It could even help someone else.
After I posted my blog on [MSU's shooting](/posts/msu) and shared it to the university snap story, a horde of people who I didn't know at all messaged me saying its helped them in one way or another.
If just one person resonates with what I say, or otherwise got something genuinely useful out of it (even if it is just learning from my mistakes) ‚Äî if it helps even one person ‚Äî then it was a worthwhile pursuit.
This is also true of this post, which I'm writing in the hopes that someone else might come by and find it helpful.

# Blogs 

Paul Graham's[^who?] essays contain some of my favorite advice on writing:

- [Write Simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html)
- [Write Like You Talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)

And some of the benefits/effects of writing ([Putting Ideas Into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)).

Other, more generally direction-oriented essays that are also pretty good:

- [Life Is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)
- [Earnestness](http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html)
- [Although of course you end up becoming yourself](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/choosing-to-become-yourself/)

These form some of my core beliefs and I frequently go back to them in times of crisis, indecision, or uncertainty.

A few more, for my sake:

- [finding the right people](https://nicoles.substack.com/p/finding-the-right-people)
- [You don't need to work on hard problems](https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/)
- [it's okay to not know](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/it-is-okay-to-not-know/)

# Music

I grew up [playing piano](https://www.kennethsun.net/posts/c-sharp-minor), but never really listening to music, and then not interacting with many people meant my music library was stagnant for the longest time.
Now it's loosely linked to my identity and holds significance in my life.

Plugs (my playlists that you should go like and also follow me on spotify because i need clout):

- [Perform Ejection Manoeuvre](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0JKgiTGaaXoUpfLvEPd7YM?si=e0f52fa686f54dd5) (up-beat, mood amplifier)
- [sneaky in c# minor](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Pb8bbphE6qBmwzLBCMKxw?si=2a56169b9c804211) (not actually all c# minor)
- [moppy](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6wNJphAVy0JMnc01R4huU1?si=d9e08470e34846de) (sentimental songs)
- [afternoon drizzle w/ no clouds](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/31x7zX0tMb33ImS2FQloMy?si=8e06db6637514be3) (aesthetic chill)

I generally go over my playlists every other month or so to update them (remove vestige songs, make more categories, etc.).
I think it's interesting how different songs represent different moods, which evolves over time.
There are almost no pop songs in my favorite playlists, because even if I add them, they tend to live very ephemeral lives in the playlist (i.e. I get tired of them very quickly).

# Poems
> Tell all the truth but tell it slant.
> -_Emily Dickinson_

- [Invictus](https://poets.org/poem/invictus). This is really definitive of my preferred mentality in life.
- [The View from Halfway Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1_EBSlnDlU). This is a scene from [Bojack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman); contains suicide.
- [This Be The Verse](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse). Generational trauma. Also funny.
- [I measure every grief I meet](https://poets.org/poem/i-measure-every-grief-i-meet-561) - Emily Dickinson
- [Hope is the thing with feathers](https://poets.org/poem/hope-thing-feathers-254) - Emily Dickinson

# Books

### [The Little Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) <small class='whisper'> (ou Le Petit Prince si tu veut) </small>

> ‚ÄúAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.‚Äù 

How could you not like this book? Do you hate life itself?
The Little Prince is a reminder to live.

> ‚ÄúI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more. It is such a secret place, the land of tears.‚Äù

### [The Humans](https://www.amazon.com/Humans-Novel-Matt-Haig/dp/1476730598) by Matt Haig

This book is just so damn quotable and heartwarming.
It's about an alien sent to Earth to assassinate a math professor who made a significant discovery.

- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. It‚Äôs the warm bits that matter.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe news should start with mathematics, then poetry, and move down from there.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever be afraid of telling someone you love them. There are things wrong with your world, but an excess of love is not one.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAs a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you‚Äôd be happy to die doing.‚Äù

### [Mathematics for Human Flourishing](https://www.francissu.com/flourishing) by Francis Su

Easy to read, thoughtful, inspiring, and suitable for everyone (even if you think you don't like math). 
It's a philosophy book written by a math professor, if you will.
There is very little math involved here (but fun puzzles!), and it's very welcoming.

The practice of mathematics (and of the mathematical sciences) can feel intimidating to the point of elitism. 
I also had that impression, but it is in fact a very deeply human pursuit with all sorts of ties to human values and desires.

### [Seveneves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves) by Neal Stephenson

This is an incredible and realistic piece of SF (that's science fiction for all you non-nerds).
Rigorously researched, Stephenson creates an immersive story where the moon mysteriously explodes and humanity has to figure out a way to survive the consequences.
They take to orbit. They go underground. 
Visceral imagery and technological realism that are feasible _right now_ are what makes this book so great. 

# Shows

### Bojack Horseman
Amazing show. 
Dark humor, themes of mental illness, coping, philosophical questions of life. 
(For Breaking Bad fans, Todd is voiced by Aaron Paul)

### Community
Super well thought out plotline with many running gags. 
Lots of big-name [cast members](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439629/).

[^1]: to be honest, notion is a more beginner-friendly alternative and probably better suited to you. I've used Notion extensively as well, and it's still definitely a very powerful tool for organization.
[^actually...]: for some unknown reason, firefox refuses to be tiled on launch and requires me clicking on it in the dock to fully open. but with that one exception things are good. actually another pain is dealing with long config windows that shouldn't be tiled, but there is always a bind to convert them back to a floating window.
[^who?]: if you are unaware, he co-founded the [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com), which is a start-up incubator that funded things like Airbnb.
