i've been writing college admissions essays (again), and it is really frustrating because 1) the prompts are hard, so you have to really dig deep to come up with a meaningful response and 2) once you have an answer, you need to squeeze it into less than 250 words, truncating most of contextual information.

i'd like to annotate some of the essays i wrote, even if they won't be seen by admissions counselors, at least i'll get to tell the full story.

here is the first one:

> ###### Please discuss why you are considering transferring from your current college or university.*   _225 words or fewer_
> My experience at MSU has been great. I became a Physics ULA (Undergraduate Learning Assistant), started a MakerClub, and got involved in fun research. I've loved, for the most part<sup>1</sup>, every professor I've had and I'm certainly learning a lot, but I don't feel quite at home here. 
>
> Being here unfortunately reminds me of my dark ages (aka middle school) in suburban Ohio. 
> There are overt aggressions against people like me, and little things, too. Here, I'm reminded of what it felt like to be seen as a stereotype.<sup>2</sup>
>
> In my classes, I have the urge to find other material online to supplement what I view as relatively shallow introductions to topics I'm really interested in, and which I feel are not covered completely. 
> But using supplements is really hard, because I typically don't have anyone to work with and I have other deadlines in other classes, so in the end I walk away unsatisfied. 
> I think rigor is a cultural property, and one that is hard to imitate. [Target institution] has this, I believe, among other things unique to its culture.
> 
> My biggest regret in high school was to not have gone much outside of my regular school schedule in search of opportunities to enrich myself. But now that I'm finally excited to come out of my hole, I feel somewhat muzzled.

**1:** _most_ of them have been awesome, but some, like my current physics professor, have been so awful that i think i would hate physics if she were my first exposure to it.
it's a little crazy how much your first exposure to a subject changes your whole perspective, and also how much the instructor factors into that first impression.

i love the math department though. before i came to campus i'd heard from friends that the math department was horrible, but that could not be further from my experience. maybe it's because they were in the lower maths, but all my math profs: linear algebra with theory, axiomatic geometry, and ordinary differential equations with theory, have been amazing, supportive teachers. 
not to mention that they are always very good-humored people.

last semester, i was in my linear algebra prof's office hours every week. sometimes we talked about linear algebra, other times more general math, advice on entering academia (i want to be a professor as well), stories, etc. 
it was a great time, and i don't feel bad saying that she is more fun to talk to than a lot of people my age (she is also not that old, tbf). 

**2:** what happened in suburban Ohio, you might ask? only what happens to every asian kid in an all-white, republican town in the early 2010's. 
as this preceeded the release of "13 reasons why", the concept of bullying and suicide did not exist in pop culture.

when i later moved to novi at the beginning of high school, it was really a bit of a shock to remember that there actually does exist people who aren't white with blonde hair. 
coming to MSU, however, was the reverse culture shock, like i was back on the curbs of Ohio wrestling with the unimaginable power of ignorance.
 
one time during the fall term my roommate brought one of his best friends into our room. 
i was double-fisting these [fruit jelly cups](https://www.amazon.com/Funtasty-Assorted-Popping-Pearls-Friendly/dp/B09W69RF5L/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3FR9TUQLHPU5Q&keywords=fruit+jelly+cup&qid=1676093145&sprefix=fruit+%2Caps%2C1115&sr=8-9) and she pointed and went, "what is _that?_"

i'd intended on hoarding all of the delicious jelly cups but, veering on the side of etiquette, explained what they are and offered one to her.
