_spoilers ahead, obviously. but it's mostly for oppenheimer, which is like, \*spoiler alert\*- the bomb **does** go off._

yesterday, I ditched work early to watch Barbenheimer — first barbie, then oppenheimer. 
as a physics student, i'm both surprised and disappointed to say that barbie is a better movie than oppenheimer. 

barbie was great because it was funny, and it was serious. 
it was simultaneously about something insignificant to the vast majority of its audience, something scoffed at by about 50% of the world's population (which is exactly the issue), yet unfolding the problem in such an absurd fashion that it's impossible not to laugh and cry at the same time.

enough praise, here's why oppenheimer failed to hit the nail.

## nuclear chain reaction

im of course referring to the last scene, where we see oppenheimer talk to einstein by the lake, and tells him that he's afraid they've actually started a chain reaction. 

we all took history. or if we didn't, we all saw the multiple visceral hallucinations oppenheimer had about all-out nuclear warfare, and how nonproliferation became his goal after the war. 
to then say "i think we've started a chain reaction" in such a grave tone and end the movie as such feels like such a cheap way to sum off the legacy of the manhattan project, like a really bad magic trick that builds and builds and ends up being lame. 

it's the kind of thing that any high school english student could write a neat little essay about given only the facts of how A) a fission bomb works and B) knowledge of the existence of the cold war. 
it's low-hanging fruit that tries to nicely wrap up the movie in a literary bow but misses the mark in terms of tone and feel. 
in reailty it's _ironic_, but the movie tried to made it feel _deep_ and _philosophical_.

it's an idea that comes out of a writing student who’s just learning to write.

## the black and white vs. color business

this is the most glaringly confusing things about oppenheimer, with explanations being either  [b&w is strauss, colored is oppenheimer](https://www.insider.com/why-oppenheimer-has-black-and-white-color-scenes-explanation-2023-7), or [b&w is objective, colored is subjective](https://screenrant.com/oppenheimer-movie-black-white-color-differences-changes-explained/). 

neither fully makes sense, because why is strauss b&w? 
because he holds on to old grudges? that's a stretch. 
because everyone was either with him or against him? or because he was staunchly anti-communist? also big stretches.

because those scenes are objective? clearly no.
the events in b&w, like his appeal hearing, happened to him just as much as the rest of the movie. 
if anything, they are at most a bit less personal to oppenheimer and focused more on people around him. 
but i dont think this is a big enough point to justify a totally different palette that already has well-established meanings, e.g.:
1. to separate past events from present events
2. in a modern historical film, used in conjunction with other or camera techniques to imitate "real historical recordings"

nolan's use of b&w is close to the second one, but not exactly.
maybe i just didn't notice it, but besides the color difference there wasn't anything else that popped into attention between the two scene types.
he says:

> I wrote the script in first person, it was the first time I've done that.
> It made it clear to anyone who read the script that we're on this ride with Oppenheimer

> hey nolan, we're not reading the script. 

put into this framework, it does make sense that colored scenes are meant to put us, the audience, right there besides oppenheimer, with the b&w scenes intending to place us as 3rd-party observers to the whole situation. 
i understand what he tried to do, but i dont think it was _effective._
it's not that you cant b&w something to relay a different meaning than the conventional, but it has to be clear to the audience what you're doing.

he had also apparently labeled the colored scenes "fission" and the b&w scenes "fusion", at the very beginning? 
i don't even want to get into what that's about but im sure it's some connection that's way out there.

we see again that nolan tries to make his movie _deep_, and _subtle_, he loves to play with _time_, _subjectivity vs objectivity_.
much attention is drawn to these things. but in this case it’s done so subtlely and is a big stretch, and for the "chain reaction" it’s meant to be deep but so overimplied that you’d do better to just come out and say it instead of being so roundadbout just to make a nice comparison

## short psychoanalysis tangent

there's a non-ignorable trend of film elitism: you're only supposed to hear tenet's dialogue in IMAX, watch oppenheimer on 70mm, plus the two aforementioned problems.
ngl i think he’s got too much attention these days and become obsessed with grandiose gestures. 
he tries too hard to make his movies "special" and "meaningful" and "original". 

interstellar didn't have this problem.
and dunkirk was _amazing_. 

i think he enjoys making random choices in his films and justifying them as "creative decisions", all the while people watching the movies get confused and talk about it thus putting him in the spotlight. 
tenet was a stupid movie about predetermination, and oppenheimer was told from two different perspectives. 
none of this is hard to grasp if he would just make it clear, but instead he prefers to be an ~artist~.

## non-linear timeline

too confusing. 
you're using black & white AND color AND they were both mixed up in different timelines AND play clips in the same section out of order? 
me telling a story drunk and on adderall would be less confusing.

i don't even know how many disjoint linear sequences there were in that movie, AND I KNEW THE STORY ALREADY.

## too much cheering after trinity

for a movie that was supposed to capture the gravity of the atomic bomb and the objections of all the scientists on the project (oppenheimer included), there sure was a lot of cheering after the trinity test. 

[:here's the interview clip of oppenheimer where he talks about the people's reaction after the test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac&pp=ygUdb3BwZW5oZWltZXIgaSBhbSBiZWNvbWUgZGVhdGg%3D)
(it is not the same as in the film)

this might be a small thing to pick at, but i think it's extremely important for the bomb to be seen and felt, unianimously, through all the scientists of the project, not as something to cheer for but something to be feared.

their reaction was the most important part of the entire movie, and i didnt think it was made clear that it was not just oppenheimer who was upset by the bomb. 
nolan focused on oppenheimer as if he alone carried this burden, when [:both the invention](#recognition) and the burden were far from his alone. 


## positives

- great sound design
- good cast
- A+ for historical figures accuracy and easter eggs (godel, bohr, heisenberg, fermi,...)

# \:x recognition

i'd cry about oppenheimer getting credited for the entire project and way too many people being unrecognized, but i guess that's historically accurate.
