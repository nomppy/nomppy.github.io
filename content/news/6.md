Hi, I'm still alive. 
I've just been very busy procrastinating all the work I'd planned to do over the summer.

**New stuff:**

I have [\:a new puzzle](#puzzle-6), though be warned the solution is non-obvious!
Let me know if you think you have a solution :)

### \:x puzzle 6
You are standing in front of a line of 5 people, four of whom are "togglers", and one is a truth teller. 
The truth teller always tells the truth, but a toggler will always alternate telling the truth and telling the lie. 

How do you determine who is the truth teller using only two questions?

Some stipulations and helpful info:
- One question can only be addressed to one person
- Everyone in line knows who the truth teller is, who the togglers are, and whether a given person is currently telling the truth. 
- With the exception of the above rule, there is no limit to what questions you may pose.
