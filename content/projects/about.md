### A few quick notes on this page:

Hey! This is where most of my technical work can be found. Sometimes I may not have had time to write a full post, but I will try to keep up with the latest developments. For more writing content, please visit the [blogs](/blogs) page.

The purpose of these posts are multi-fold. One, to share my work with others in the hopes that they can get something out of it. Two, to remind my future self &mdash; who is intelligent but has forgotten &mdash; of what I did before.

And lastly, I often find that in writing in detail about something, you inevitably learn something new in the process. A part of the project you hadn't considered before until you begun to write about it; some concept you're not entirely familiar with that you now have to explain. In any case, I confess that I have a problem of wanting to explain things to others, and who better an interested listner than my future self?
