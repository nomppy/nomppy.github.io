there are just _so many things to do._

it occurred to me most of the way through the week that i was stressed and anxious about how the term would evolve, in a way that complaining about each thing alone wouldnt help. 
i had to step back and look at everything as a whole. i had to write.

somewhere on my computer is a file named `lessons.md`, which is a dated log of things i’ve learned “the hard way”. sadly, some lessons are frequent visitors. “blind stubbornness in the face of problems” being one of them. 

still, when i remember this file exists and am reminded of my bad habit. i can consciously try to avoid repeating the same mistake. this kind of writing is reflective, and meta, but usually helpful.

another kind is the kind im writing now, written with the intent of being read by someone else. 
it’s meant to be intimate, conversational, maybe semi-helpful, but more often than not it’s just me telling you something about myself. i think when you read what someone wrote, you always come away knowing more about that person, whether they intended it or not.

for example, i write a good amount and make them public on my website, and sometimes my friends would read them, or strangers.
because such a candid side of you shows through writing, which isnt always easy to show in real life — and it is the *real* you, i would argue — some of my friends know me a lot better than i know them. 
i might even know better, say, jk rowling, or rupi kaur, or the author of “the little prince”, than i know some of my friends.

i find that to be both odd and amazing. 
odd, because i know so much about antoine de saint-exupery without having ever met him, yet know comparatively little of people who i see everyday. 
but amazing, because there’s absolutely nothing standing in the way of friends writing to be read by each other.

in fact, i think one of the biggest arguments for writing and reading is to keep up, and be kept up with, by ones’ friends.

other benefits of writing apply, but its all unimportant compared to the very ability to actually **see** someone, and to **be seen**.

_do you see what i'm saying? have you ever thought about this? here, have a think about this. let's think about this together._
