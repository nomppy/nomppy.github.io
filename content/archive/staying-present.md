### staying present
there are so many thoughts swirling around my brain at all times that grabbing one means losing track of another. ULA, SULI, REU, physics research, briggs research, writing, update website, school work, discussion posts, read that book, read that other book, get food, text friends, tax forms, make that thing for laure, reply to the nice professor's email, finish reading that psych paper, sign up for grading, apply for scholarships, study abroad, is it too expensive to study abroad? do i even apply? clean the fridge, do the laundry, did i lock my bike inside? order food for tomorrow, take a nap.

im not worried.

no, seriously, i'm not. i'm provably a pro at [organizing]() my life. this may all seem a lot, but i can manage with a calendar and a well-maintained todo list. it's just... at times, it's hard to remember what you were thinking about that was so important just a second ago, and of course there's always the difficulty in deciding what to do first. 

i find it helpful to keep a running record of what it is you really value, are aiming towards, or want, and to refer back to it in times of chaos and indecision (one implies the other). 
a carefully thought out thing like this can really help keep you on track, and the only cost is re-calibrating it every other month of so, which is even a fruitful activity on its own.

i was just telling my friend the other day, who was struggling to move past a somewhat recent breakup, that distracting himself with school or other friends isn't a viable long-term solution, but perhaps a deeper look inside the self to figure out what one really wants in life would help ameliorate feelings of longing for something already in the past, by comparison.

people are fond of saying that your life is like a train: you'll arrive at some station, people will get on, and perhaps you'll ride with these people for a while. 
but inevitably, and not infrequently, people will get off, and there is nothing you can do about someone once they've gotten off[^1].

i like this analogy a lot — not in the least because of the relationships ending part, that part sucks — but because it also represents another attitude i think everyone should hold towards life. imagine the train passes through the beautiful Swiss countryside. 
if you're too busy ruminating over what might've been, or sulking about some fuss that happened when you were boarding the train, or too occupied with some, say, dreadful book for masochists, everything outside is just a blur. 

> erm... okay, sure.. let's say for the moment that that's an decent analogy. 
> it still doesn't change the fact that you have more things to do than you have braincells for. 
> do you even remember half of the thoughts you have in a day? how about a quarter...? 

you are correct. i am a stupid person with very few braincells. 
that's why i rely on my tools to stay organized. i'm provably a pro at organizing my life.
what i can't remember to do, i rely on task lists and evenly space out tasks so that i'm not overwhelmed on any given day.

> but there's _so much_ — how can you focus on anything in particular when, in fact, everything is swirling around in your head?

well, the thing is... the _point_ is that you don't really focus on anything. 
your urge to "focus" on something comes from anxiety over all the things going on in your life. in other words, if your body can't catch up to your head, you're already overwhelmed. 

you know the feeling: hyper, jumpy, racing thoughts. 
sometimes this feels good. you're a _machine_. quick, efficient, precise.
but also... mechanical, busy, panicked, easily distracted... oh look- a phone! pick it up, open random apps, put it down, check your email, pick up your phone again...

as someone who is also perpetually busy, i understand the urge to get. stuff. done. but in order to be productive, you need to first be calm. 
there's a lot to do, but you don't have to do everything right now. 

you just need to start with one.

### my personal philosophy
my personal philosophy is that everything i do should be worth doing, and that i should be relatively happy doing it. you might note that generally speaking, there aren't a lot of things that have zero worth. the more frequent scenario is to have many things, each of them a genuinely worthwhile activity on its own, but not enough time to do all of them.

but this is an enviable problem to have! it is decidedly better to choose between what to do than to have nothing interesting to do. the problem still stands, however, that of deciding which things you want to prioritize.

in my life, i tend to prioritize academics, research, and hobbies (e.g. playing piano, reading, writing, making things). 
few people like to admit that they don't prioritize their relationships with peers, but when the going gets rough, friend hangouts are often the first to disappear.

i don't think my priorities ideal. not because they suck, but because i don't think such an ideal exists. 
what you prioritize/value is largely a matter of taste (and probably upbringing, since it has to do with [what you want to want]()), and even if there was some "ideal priorities", it's impossible to change peoples' minds anyway.

the only thing i have left to say is to prioritize balance as well. i think that this applies no matter what your preferences are, because i think it's hard to enjoy life if one aspect of your life is over-prioritized.
this, of course, relates back to staying present. if you have to force yourself to do something and end up getting very little enjoyment out of it[^2], then it is probably not worth doing.

### sometimes, you have to let go of something to keep going
i hate that i'm writing this

### serenity
in my experience, if you do things you wouldnt usually do, life tends to reward you with things that wouldnt usually happen. and if you, like me, find serendipity joyful, then this is a sure way to have more unexpected experiences in your life. 

the converse is certainly true. if you only do the things you usually do, then you’ll only experience the things that will usually happen. maybe you prefer routine over discovery/novelty, and there’s nothing wrong with that.


[^1]: i want to clarify that i don't believe in such things as fate or destiny. i'm not saying here that everyone some predetermined "stop" that they'd get off at. i think there are certainly things you can do to change the outcome of a relationship, but not after its over.

[^2]: i should note that this is distinct from forcing yourself to stop, say, procrastinating on writing a blog but finding it enjoyable once you start. what i mean only applies to something that you do but almost _never_ get enjoyment out of, but which you do anyway for one reason or another. you can certainly force yourself to do math homework and be glad that you did, because you learned something.
