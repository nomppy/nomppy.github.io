### Jupyter's ring

I used to worship you,  
Jupyter,  
with white lambs  
on the Ides  
of January.  
I sang Songs  
of Achilles  
to you nightly  
beside your bed,  
and called up  
white lilies  
for you while  
you wept.  
But where were you,  
Jupyter,  
when I called  
for you?  
(When I called  
until my voice  
ran foul.)  
Still I circle you,  
Jupyter,  
my brittle little  
heart in orbit around  
the thought of you,  
this cult of you.  
Jupyter,  
if that is  
even your name,  
I remember  
how you envied  
saturn's rings.  
Is that why  
I crushed myself 
into little pieces,  
to become  
a simmering ring?
