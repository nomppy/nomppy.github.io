<!-- Welcome to my website! I'm Kenneth. I like to learn about how the world works. My favorite fruit is strawberry and my favorite color is #1998DB (the lighter blue color on this page). -->


### Me
Hello and welcome to my website.
I primarily study physics and math, though I am also very interested in psychology, philosophy, and history. 

I also like playing piano, coding, reading[^1], and writing (which [you can read](/posts)).

### Contact
Feel free to get in touch through email: <a href="mailto:kennett.sun@gmail.com">kennett.sun@gmail.com</a>. 
I'm usually happy to talk about anything and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

### Site
I wrote this website from scratch using Nuxt.js and Jekyll. 
The page is statically hosted with Github Pages. 
Source code for the site can be found on Github ([link to repository](https://github.com/spesthecat/spesthecat.github.io)).

[^1]: Currently, I am reading "Wuthering Heights" and "Mathematics for Human Flourishing". More on [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/profile/kennethsibyl).
