<!-- Welcome to my website! I'm Kenneth. I like to learn about how the world works. My favorite fruit is strawberry and my favorite color is #1998DB (the lighter blue color on this page). -->


### Me
Hello and welcome to my website.
I primarily study physics and math, though I am also very interested in psychology, philosophy, and history. 

I also like playing piano, coding, reading[^1], and writing (which [you can read](/posts) if you want to learn more).

### Contact
The easiest way to reach me is probably by email: <a href="mailto:kennett.sun@gmail.com">kennett.sun@gmail.com</a>. Feel free to get in touch for any reason! I'm usually happy to talk about anything and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

You're also welcome to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethh-sun/) or message me on Insta: [@kennethh.sun](https://www.instagram.com/kennethh.sun/).

### Site
I wrote this website from scratch using Nuxt.js and Jekyll. The page is statically hosted with Github Pages. Source code for the site can be found on Github ([link to repository](https://github.com/spesthecat/spesthecat.github.io)).

[^1]: Currently, I am reading "Wuthering Heights" and "Mathematics for Human Flourishing". More on [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/profile/kennethsibyl).
