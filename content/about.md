<!-- Welcome to my website! I'm Kenneth. I like to learn about how the world works. My favorite fruit is strawberry and my favorite color is #1998DB (the lighter blue color on this page). -->


### Me
Hello and welcome to my website.
I primarily study physics and math, though I am also very interested in psychology, sociology, and other random nerdy stuff. 

I enjoy playing piano, coding, messing with computers in general, board games, and I generally enjoy puzzles. 
Reading and writing are big hobbies of mine, and you can read some of what I write [here](/posts).

### Contact
I offer writing services and tutoring in math, physics, and computer science. 
Feel free to get in touch through email: <a href="mailto:kennett.sun@gmail.com">kennett.sun@gmail.com</a>. 
I'm usually happy to talk about anything and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
