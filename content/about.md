<!-- Welcome to my website! I'm Kenneth. I like to learn about how the world works. My favorite fruit is strawberry and my favorite color is #1998DB (the lighter blue color on this page). -->


### Me
Hello and welcome to my website.
I primarily study physics and math, though I am also very interested in psychology, philosophy, and history. 

I also like playing piano, coding, and messing with computers in general. 
I'm always down to play board games and generally enjoy puzzles. 
Reading and writing are big hobbies of mine, and you can read some of what I write [here](/posts).
