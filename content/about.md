I like poetry, cats, board games/puzzles, pretty shapes, rain, music ([my Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/tbkwdf650gvc7vlikkdmoj1k1?si=6a456a77516f4066)). There are some writings at [/posts](/posts), and I also have an author profile on [The Michigan Daily](https://www.michigandaily.com/author/sunken/).
