strike force heroes is the eigenvector of my life.

i was just talking to my friend for four straight hours, about this chinese novel series i'd just rediscovered, the game that was my version of pokemon (but so much better).
today i got back access to the chinse gaming website i always went on as a kid. 
and as we were sitting there waiting for the 3d printer to print something, i went on my website and started showing my friend the games i'd used to play. 
i went to sai er hao, with all its little spirit animals and scrolled through the list of them. 
i was like, "I KNOW THIS ONE", and "OH I remember this!" and "OMG this guy had this ability."
there was my favorite card game, where you played as characters from the three-warring states part of old chinese history. 
there was the _other_ pokemon clone, which i'm told was mostly played by girls — that tracks, i didn't really remember it that well.

as i poked more around on the website my eyes caught on this game called dou luo da lu.
they made it into a game??
i pasted the name into search and found out that they also made it a show??

it was a book series i'd read ages ago, when i was in first grade. 
it started out as an internet novel, as most of these things did. 
the author published chapter after chapter on a blog-style website, and subscribers to the novel get updates. 
there were huge sites dedicated to these internet novels. 
honestly the closest parallel i can think of in american culture is fanfiction (though if you know of similar sites, please lmk)

so this book is about this guy who tried to kill himself and actually teleported into another universe, where people don't fight with weapons or magic but at the age of six were awoken with "spirits", which could be anything from hammers or flutes to plants and animals.
it's basically percy jackson but cooler.
it eventually became popular enough that the author made it into a book and published it. 
it went wild. 
everybody in my first-grade class had read it within a month, and the few people who owned hardcopies were worshipped and their books treated like bibles being passed around.
it made such big waves at the time that the teachers had to tell kids to stop reading. 
i remember my teacher holding the book up in class one day and pointed to it, "is this the book you're all crazy about? stop reading it."

of course i read it. 
actually i read it when it was still just an internet novel.
the novel was _3 million_ chinese characters long. 
keep in mind that chinese is a denser language than english, too. 
and that was only the first book.
there are five total and i think i read _all of them_.

anyway i start explaining the plot of the book to my friend, not at all containing my excitement as those scenes rushed back to me after 9 years of buried in the dirt.
i must've been talking about the premise of the book to my friend for something like twenty minutes, just from the details that i somehow still remembered.
i found a fandom wiki and went through all of the main characters abilities, his spirits and these weird things called "domains"[^fields].
the wiki was _several pages long_, all just for this one character.

then my friend starts texting their friend about the things that i was saying, asking if they knew of this book.
the guy texts back and he says, "tell kenneth this and asks him what he thinks of...", and eventually my friend just gives me the laptop and im typing to this guy.
we chat about the chinese gaming website, sai er hao, and the novel series, too. 
at some point i ask him, "when did you leave china?"

my friend _bursts out laughing_, and says in the most obvious, matter-of-fact, not at all holding in the laughter, "HE'S RUSSIAN"
i say "WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE"S RUSSIAN."

"HE'S NOT CHINESE HE'S RUSSIAN"

"HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT HE'S NOT CHINESE. YOU STARTED TEXTING THIS GUY TELLING HIM ABOUT THE CHINESE STUFF THAT I'M TELLING YOU, HE KNOWS CHINESE NOVELS AND CHINESE GAMES, AND HE'S RUSSIAN!?"




i feel so incredibly rooted to my cultural heritage right now.
all of these years i'd pretty much forgotten about the things i used to do as a kid.
in my mind, it's like i was just born here at age 9.

i knew that i'd lived in china before.
i knew i lived with my cousin, went to school, and had a friend with whom i once attempted to shoplift something and it went very poorly.
but none of what i did stayed with me. 
except for the internet novel reading, for the first year after i moved to america i kept reading internet novels.
i'd sit on the living room floor, open up the browser on our smart tv and go to the novel site.
i would have a blurtooth keyboard in my hand and tap, tapping it to scroll down, and whenever my mom walked in front of me i'd be like "mOM, get out of the way".

all in all i must've read at least a dozen chinese internet novels, which is probably the only reason i'm decent at writing[^].
but i didn't keep playing chinese video games, and i stopped reading before the year had passed.
i was trying really hard to assimilate into american culture.
to be frank, i felt really out of place there[^racism], so i really just wanted to severe any connection to chinese culture.

all this time, i thought that overwatch was my shooter-awakening — the game that got me into shooter games, but that is so far from the truth!
i was shooting people in the head on 4399 when i was a first grader in china. 
and strike force heroes.. i am so upset that the vast majority of these games were flash games and no longer work, but it looks like strike force heroes is getting a remake and going to be released on steam sometime this year.

all this time, the majority of my childhood was locked behind a box.
**I** had locked it, all those years ago when i first moved, out of shame.
And as soon as I unlocked it, 9 years of memories came rushing back seemingly from _nowhere._

For me my childhood used to be a grey blob.
now, well, now it's still a blob, but it's much less grey and more colorful.

on 4399, there were a lot of knockoff games. 
sai er hao is knockoff pokemon, strike force heroes was translated into chinese. 
we had lava boy and water girl, except there was also a version where you are both just kinf of invincible (which kind of ruins the whole point? idk).
we had copies and invincible versions of everything!— plants vs. zombies, strike force heroes. 

somehow i'd forgotten all about my childhood, buried for nine years, until recently when i went back to 4399 and the whole network of neurons just fired.

i've already downloaded dou luo da di as an ebook — the site's content is not free anymore, which, good for the authors they're actually making money, but of course i'm not paying for it — luckily chinese internet novels are probably amongst the most pirated texts.
i got a copy easily and i will definitely, **definitely** be reading this as soon as i'm done with my finals.
