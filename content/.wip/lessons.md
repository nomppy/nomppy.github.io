# things i've learned about myself

**should get obsidian charts working for graphical data**

fall 2022, dont put more effort into people if they're not reciprocating. 

2022 week 43, stop worrying so much about optimizing for the future. 

2022 week 47, how to prioritize things

2022 week 48, dont bang head so hard against singular problems. take a break and come back to it. (i later refuted this lesson when i struggled against understanding an ODE proof for like, two whole days, as well as trying to make decisions regarding transfer)

2022 week 49, advanced time management. 
i need to stay organized or else i'll go crazy.

in 2023 week 9, right before springbreak, i had really a stressful week and spent way too long ruminating over decisions. i felt burnt out, and realized that i need to have balance.

in 2023 weeks 11 and 12, after springbreak, i had a really sad and lonely existence. 

> I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.  
> - Sylvia Plath (of course)

i got slightly overwhelmed which led to stressing out which led to feeling sad and unmotivated which exacerbated [impostor syndrome](/impostor) which made me stop seeing friends which made me feel lonely which made me more sad.

i learned: when lonely and sad, go do stuff with friends. when i get busy or sad (or both), i get out of touch with myself and stop reflecting as much. 
i consistently did a good job of this during first semester, but the habit fell off when winter break started.
a lot of other things also changed, but i was definitely happier that first semester

2023-W13: self-respect and self-love. self-acceptance?

spring 2023, when doing something new, start with a _small_ project. 

sometimes this is more easily said than done, since interesting projects will inherently skew towards more complex, but whenever possible one should always go for the simplest project that is interesting to them. 
being overly ambitious in what you are trying to do doesn't just carry the risk of being overloaded with work, but could also be incredibly discouraging when you get stuck in the first steps of the project because, well, you don't know how to do any of it!

When you do have a project, remember this! â€” it is better to do some work, _any amount of work_, than to do nothing at all. 
Set reasonable goals for yourself and make sure you can consistently meet them, that's the key to getting lots of stuff done.

If this year of math has taught me anything, it's that it is okay to not figure out a problem right away. 
Whether it be a major life decision, relationship difficulty, or really just an intractable exercise, it is really okay to not spend every waking moment working toward an answer.

2023-W28: don't mix wine and rum when drinking.

2023-W30: 
im coming up on the last week of my internship. 
if there is one thing i've learned for future instances, is to better communicate when i am not enjoying my work, so that something can be done about it. 
i need to advocate for myself.
having fun is probably more important than other things you're worried about at the time.
even if it seems that nothing could be done by complaining, still complain (respectfull), because you never know.
