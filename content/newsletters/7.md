## :2023-11-08 - poetry meets math
wow, I forgot about this. but i'm back! :)

**some news:**
1. i'm a new columnist for the michigan daily 
2. i wrote up something i've been thinking about for a while now - the connections between poetry and math, and why someone might want to study both of them. 
3. it's published on the michigan daily's website: [When Poetry meets Math and they get drunk.](https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/when-poetry-meets-math-and-they-get-drunk/)

I hope midterms went well for those of y'all who are in school. but in case they didnt, i thought i'd include some media that i've been really into lately in the hopes that they can make your day a little better :)

Music:
- Japanese jazz is honestly so, so good. This is an [iconic one](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Uk4xYpKI1WIOtWqS6fs62?si=8d40df2e7fd544f7) by Ryu Fukui, and a [catchy](https://open.spotify.com/track/7EkfLobuyqgITbfn3BFmXh?si=75a44afdce30480b) one that I don't think many people know. (btw I'd love to get music recs if you have any)
- I don't listen to a lot of (any) jpop but [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1uK4zAdMcBRyinAOArUA5X?si=c7aba4628ea64b9d) by Vaundy definitely slays

Shows:
- Season 2 of Our Flag Means Death is out on HBO Max, and it's so good. It's about an English aristocrat who decided he'd abandon his family and become a "gentleman pirate". Super light humor. Easy to watch. Episodes are short.
- The Midnight Gospel is featured in my piece, but here I am blatantly promoting it again. WHy? Because it's good!! 

okay, that's all. take care <3
